<a href="learning-mode">LEARNING</a> mode allows you to <em>teach</em> the Rover a mission by manually driving around recording the desired waypoints. <!--more-->

[tip]This is the easiest way to create a mission on Rover. Alternatively you can <a href="common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events">plan a mission using Mission Planner</a> or some other GCS.[/tip]


To add waypoints in <em>Learning Mode</em>:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have GPS lock (solid blue LED on APM).</li>
<li>Turn on <em>Learning mode</em> using the mode switch.</li>
<li>Drive around manually and flick the CH7 toggle when you want the autopilot to record a waypoint.</li>
</ul>

The waypoints will be added to the end of the current mission stored in the rover. Once you're done, you can switch into <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> mode and the Rover should retrace your steps, hitting all the waypoints you recorded.

If you're connected to the <em>Mission Planner</em>, you can click <strong>Read WPs</strong> on the <em>Flight Planner</em> screen and it will show the recorded waypoints on a map.

[note]You can erase the mission stored in the rover by toggling the CH7 switch while in <a href="manual-mode">Manual</a> mode.[/note]
