<h1 class="postbody"><strong>June 19, 2015: Rover 2.50 released:</strong></h1>
The ArduPilot development team has released version 2.50 of APM:Rover. This release is mostly a back-end improvement to ArduPilot but a few new features and bug fixes are included.

<strong>Re-do Accelerometer Calibration</strong>
Due to a change in the maximum accelerometer range on the Pixhawk all users must re-do their accelerometer calibration for this release.

<strong>Only 3D accel calibration</strong>
The old "1D" accelerometer calibration method has now been removed, so you must use the 3D accelerometer calibration method. The old method was removed because a significant number of users had poor experiences.


Changes in this release are:


<ul>
	<li>CLI_ENABLED parameter added so the CLI can now be accessed in Rover</li>
	<li>PID logging for the steering controller. It its now possible to graph what the P, I and D are doing as your driving the rover around to enable much better tuning of the vehicle.</li>
	<li>Transition from .pde file to .cpp files for improved development.</li>
	<li>GIT Submodules created for PX4Firmware, PX4Nuttx and uavcan git repositories for improved development.</li>
	<li>Followme mode now works for Rover</li>
	<li>GUIDED mode significantly improved. If you have a GCS which is in Followme mode if the user then changes mode with the RC transmitter to HOLD or anything else then the Rover will STOP listening to the</li>
	<li>Followme updated guided mode waypoints.</li>
	<li>When going into GUIDED mode the rover went into RTL - this is fixed.</li>
	<li>Added EKF_STATUS_REPORT MAVLink message</li>
	<li>64-bit timestamps in dataflash logs</li>
	<li>Numerous EKF improvements</li>
	<li>Added support for 4th Mavlink channel</li>
	<li>Added support for raw IMU logging</li>
	<li>Updated Piksi RTK GPS driver</li>
	<li>Improved support for GPS data injection (for Piksi RTK GPS)</li>
	<li>The SITL software in the loop simulation system has been completely rewritten for this release. A major change is to make it possible to run SITL on native windows without needing a Linux virtual machine. (thanks Tridge)</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="postbody"><strong>February 20, 2015: Rover 2.48 released:</strong></h1>
<p class="postbody">Hi everyone. The ardupilot team is delighted to announce the release of version 2.48 of Rover.</p>
In case anyone needs to manually download the beta release its here:
<a href="http://firmware.diydrones.com/Rover/stable/">http://firmware.diydrones.com/Rover/stable/</a>
<div class="postbody">The ardupilot development team has released version 2.48 of Rover. This release is a bug fix release with some important bugs found by the users of ardupilot.</div>
<div class="postbody">The changes in this release are:</div>
<ul>
	<li>fixed a bug that could cause short term loss of RC control with some receiver systems and configurations</li>
	<li>allowed for shorter sync pulse widths for PPM-SUM receivers on APM1 and APM2</li>
	<li>fix an issue where battery reporting could be intermittent (thanks Georgii Staroselskii!)</li>
	<li>fixed a mission handling bug that could cause a crash if jump commands form an infinite loop (thanks to Dellarb for reporting this bug)</li>
	<li>improved support for in-kernel SPI handling on Linux (thanks to John Williams)</li>
	<li>support UAVCAN based ESCs and GPS modules on Pixhawk (thanks to Pavel, Holger and and PX4 dev team)</li>
	<li>Multiple updates for the NavIO+ cape on RaspberryPi (thanks to Emlid)</li>
	<li>Lots of EKF changes</li>
	<li>added support for MAVLink packet routing</li>
	<li>added detection and recovery from faulty gyro and accel sensors</li>
	<li>added support for BBBMini Linux port</li>
	<li>increased number of AVR input channels from 8 to 11</li>
	<li>auto-set system clock based on GPS in Linux ports</li>
	<li>added SBUS FrSky telemetry support (thanks to Mathias)</li>
	<li>Added AK8963 MAG support (thanks Staroselskii Georgii)</li>
	<li>Added support for second battery</li>
	<li>Auto formatting of SDCard if it cannot be accessed on startup</li>
	<li>A number of significant performance improvements for the PX4 platform</li>
</ul>
The most important bug fix is the one for short term loss of RC control. This is a very long standing bug which didn't have a noticible impact for most people, but could cause loss of RC control for around 1 or 2 seconds for some people in certain circumstances.

The bug was in the the AP_HAL RCInput API. Each HAL backend has a flag that says whether there is a new RC input frame available. That flag was cleared by the read() method (typically hal.rcin-&gt;read()). Callers would check for new input by checking the boolean hal.rcin-&gt;new_input() function.

The problem was that read() was called from multiple places. Normally this is fine as reads from other than the main radio input loop happen before the other reads, but if the timing of the new radio frame exactly matched the loop frequency then a read from another place could clear the new_input flag and we would not see the new RC input frame. If that happened enough times we would go into a short term RC failsafe and ignore RC inputs, even in manual mode.

The fix was very simple - it is the new_input() function itself that should clear the flag, not read().

Many thanks to MarkM for helping us track down this bug by providing us with sufficient detail on how to reproduce it. In Marks case his OpenLRSng configuration happened to produce exactly the worst case timing needed to reproduce the issue. Once Tridge copied his OpenLRS
settings to his TX/RX he was able to reproduce the problem and it was easy to find and fix.

A number of users have reported occasional glitches in manual control where servos pause for short periods in past releases. It is likely that some of those issues were caused by this bug. The dev team would like to apologise for taking so long to track down this bug!

The other main change was also related to RC input. Some receivers use a PPM-SUM sync pulse width shorter than what the APM1/APM2 code was setup to handle. The OpenLRSng default sync pulse width is 3000 microseconds, but the APM1/APM2 code was written for a minimum sync pulse width of 4000 microseconds. For this release we have changed the APM1/APM2 driver to accept a sync pulse width down to 2700 microseconds.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Auto format of SD Card</strong></span>
From time to time the SD cards in the PX4 autopilots get corrupted. This isn't a surprise considering what we do to them. Your all familiar with the windows "please unmount or eject your SDCard before removing" process. Well we don't do that. In fact normal operation is to just pull the power on the SDCard - whilst its being written too!! Not to mention the horrible vibration rich environment the SDCard exists in. If the autopilot is setup in the internal innards of your plane/copter/rover this can be a nightmare to get to. To resolve that problem Tridge has added code at startup so when ArduPilot tries to mount to SDCard to access it - if that fails it will then try to format the SDCard and if successful mount the card and proceed. If the format fails then you will get the usual SOS Audio that makes most of us want to find the buzzer and rip its heart out.

I mention this in case anyone has precious logs saved on the SDCard or they are using the SDCard out of their phone with their wedding photo's on it. Probably best not to do that and assume any data on the SDCard can be deleted.

We are also looking to add a parameter to control whether the card is auto formatted on startup or not but it isn't in there yet.

Rover Developer Test Track and Typical Mission Test Course

Good news from Andrew Tridgell and the rest of the Rover (Rover) Development Team: they've pushed out a major new release (2.45). Major changes include: numerous updates for PX4 and Pixhawk, dual sensor support on the Pixhawk and reduced GPS latency for all three navigation controllers.

The following is from Tridge's <a href="http://ardupilot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=5834" target="_blank">release announcement</a>. Please post any questions or comments there.
<h2>Pixhawk updates</h2>
The biggest set of changes are for the PX4 and Pixhawk boards. The Pixhawk production boards started shipping a few weeks ago and include some nice hardware features that didn't make it into the 2.44 release. The most important of these is dual sensor support. The Pixhawk has two gyros and two accelerometers, and (if you have an external GPS/compass combo) dual compass as well. In the 2.44 release only one of each of these sensors could be used. With the 2.45 release the health of each sensor is monitored and if one sensor fails the second sensor can take over. In addition to failover support the code logs both sets of sensor values both to MAVLink and to the logs on the microSD card, which is very useful for diagnostics. We are also working on dual GPS support which we hope to get into the next release.
<h2>GPS navigation improvements</h2>
A very simple change to our GPS configuration made a big difference for this release. In previous rover releases we setup the uBlox as ENGINE_AUTOMOTIVE as we thought that would be the best match for a rover. What we discovered recently is that using the AUTOMOTIVE mode led to much more time delay (lag) in the GPS velocity data, which led to poor handling of sharp turns. We have now switched to ENGINE_AIRBORNE_4G and found that we get much better navigation at higher speed with sharp turns.
<h2>Parameter storage</h2>
Another major change for this release is the way parameters are stored on PX4 and Pixhawk. In previous releases we stored parameters on a file on the microSD card. That usually worked fine, but recently there have been a few too many issues with FAT filesystem corruption of microSD cards, especially when powering off while writing to the SD card. For this release we have moved all parameters to the EEPROM on the PX4 and the FRAM chip on the Pixhawk. This makes parameter storage independent of the microSD card, avoiding parameters becoming corrupt due to microSD card problems. Parameters from a microSD card will be automatically copied to EEPROM/FRAM when you upgrade to Rover 2.45.
<h2>Improved relay code</h2>
The relay and servo set code has had a major overhaul, with up to 4 relays now supported for MAVLink control and much better support for the DO_SET_SERVO, DO_SET_RELAY, DO_REPEAT_SERVO and DO_REPEAT_RELAY MAVLink commands. Along with these changes is a new parameter BRD_PWM_COUNT which allows you to specify how many auxillary PWM outputs to enable, with the remaining outputs being available as digital relays. This allows you to re-assign some of the aux servo outputs on Pixhawk for use as relays, by setting the RELAY_PIN, RELAY_PIN2, RELAY_PIN3 and RELAY_PIN4 parameters. The pin numbers for these pins start at 50 for the first aux servo pin, and go to 55 on Pixhawk.
<h2>Improved logging</h2>
There have been logs of logging improvements in this release. Apart from the dual sensor logging, we can now transfer on-board log files to the ground station over MAVLink, which makes it much easier to get detailed logs without having to pull a microSD card out, or boot to the CLI. We're hoping to remove the need for the CLI completely in a future release, doing everything over MAVLink.
The new logging code also includes the git version number of APM and (if needed) the PX4Firmware and PX4NuttX repositories used to build the firmware in the logs. This makes it easier to track down any issues to the exact code used.
<h2>More telemetry ports</h2>
On Pixhawk and PX4 you can now have a 3rd telemetry port, allowing USB and two serial telemetry ports to be active at the same time, which is very useful when you have an onboard computer.

Regards,

TCIII Rover2 Developer

</ul>
<h1>Rover 2.43 Released</h1>
<ul>
	<li>October 10 2013 Rover 2.43 released. Details <a href="http://diydrones.com/group/ardurover-user-group/forum/topics/apmrover2-2-43-released">here</a></li>
	<li>Tom and Tridge have just released APMrover2 2.43 for your driving pleasure!</li>
	<li>This is a major new release with a lot of improvements, especially in the area of more precise steering and navigation. Highlights include:</li>
	<li>adoption of L1 navigation code from Plane
<ul>
	<li>new more precise steering controller</li>
	<li>support for the new Pixhawk autopilot</li>
	<li>conversion to centimeter level precision throughout the code</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I'll only be able to give a rough summary of the changes here as we have had more than 1500 changes in total go into the git tree since the last release.</li>
	<li>Only some of those were related exclusively to the rover code, but a lot of them do affect rover.</li>
	<li>The most significant change is in the navigation controller.
<ul>
	<li>Earlier this year the Plane code adopted a new L1 navigation system.</li>
	<li>That was highly successful, and led to the fixed-wing plane code improving its navigation performance enormously, with much smoother and more accurate turns, and much better handling of wind, along with simpler tuning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Since then Tom and I have been working to bring the same benefits to the Rover code.
<ul>
	<li>It was a bit of a rocky start, with initial attempts not working well on real rovers.</li>
	<li>With a single set of tuning values we were able to get good results either on straight driving or in tight turns, but not in both with the same settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>We finally made progress when we wrote a new STEER2SRV steering controller that takes the output of the L1 navigation code (as a demanded lateral acceleration) and produces the steering controls.
<ul>
	<li>The new controller was based initially on the fixed-wing plane roll controller, but adapted to the physics of wheeled vehicles.</li>
	<li>That controller replaces the old classic PID based steering controller in the rover code, and provides much smoother and more adaptable steering.</li>
	<li>After we got the tuning for it right, steering on both of our rovers is now much better than it has been previously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The new steering code has been so successful in fact that I have now ported it back for use in Plane to control the ground steering on planes when taxiing and in automatic takeoff and landing.
<ul>
	<li>It has really helped with one of my planes that tends to be difficult to control during takeoff.</li>
	<li>So Rover and Plane now use the same ground steering code, just with different tuning parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The next big change that you may notice in this release is the internal move to 32 bit integer positions instead of 32 bit floating point positions.
<ul>
	<li>The reason is that 32 bit floats that represent a global latitude/longitude only have a precision of a bit over 1 meter in some parts of the world.</li>
	<li>On a plane flying at 60 knots this isn't a problem, as 1m accuracy is great, but for a rover it is not good.</li>
	<li>Switching to 32 bit integers gives us a precision of about 1cm, which is a good level for a rover.</li>
	<li>This lowers the amount of weaving of the rover as it no longer tends to jump across 1m boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>That change to 1cm accuracy had impacts in a lot of different parts of the code.
<ul>
	<li>For example, the code which takes account of GPS lag to predict the actual position of the rover needs to do its math carefully to avoid ending up with floating point rounding errors.</li>
	<li>The NMEA GPS driver needed to be modified quite a lot to read the floating point numbers in the NMEA protocol in a way that preserves centimetre level precision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The centimeter precision change doesn't mean that every rover will now navigate with cm precision.
<ul>
	<li>The rover will still be limited by the precision of its GPS and how good its steering linkages are.</li>
	<li>But if you have a good (expensive!) GPS and good hardware then Rover should be able to get much better results with this release than it could previously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Support for the new Pixhawk autopilot is another major feature of this release.
<ul>
	<li>Most of my testing for this release has been done with a Pixhawk and it has worked very well.</li>
	<li>We still support the APM1, APM2 and PX4 of course, it is just nice to also work with the latest hardware.</li>
	<li>We also are working on supporting Rover on embedded Linux boards like the BeagleBone black, and Mike McCauley is working on a port to the Flymaple board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>For this release you will need to read the new navigation tuning guide for Rover as quite a few parameters have changed.
<ul>
	<li>The full parameter list is also useful as a reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>There have been a lot of other smaller changes in this release. Here is a partial list of the more important ones:
<ul>
	<li>added new AP_BattMonitor library for common battery handling with copter and plane</li>
	<li>use GPS projected position based on estimated GPS lag for more precise waypoint turns</li>
	<li>changed STEERING more to allow for throttle nudging</li>
	<li>added RCMAP support for mapping RC channels in any order</li>
	<li>switched to using new AP_Scheduler scheduling</li>
	<li>enabled RELAY support</li>
	<li>added LEARN_CH parameter for setting which channel triggers waypoint learning</li>
	<li>support camera stabilization and camera mount controls</li>
	<li>adopted new AP_Notify system for controlling LEDs on different boards</li>
	<li>lowered default accel/gyro filter frequency to cope with rough surfaces (eg. grass)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Tom and I wish you a lot of happy rovering with this release!</li>
	<li>Cheers, Tridge</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rover 2.42 Released</h1>
<ul>
	<li>July 1, 2013: Rover version 2.42 released. Details <a href="http://diydrones.com/group/ardurover-user-group/forum/topics/apmrover2-2-42-released">here</a></li>
	<li>This release contains numerous small improvements that have accumulated over the last couple of months.</li>
	<li>Many of the improvements came out of the period of intensive development and testing that Tom and I put into the code before the ACV2013 competition (which we were delighted to win!)</li>
	<li>The main improvements are:
<ul>
	<li>fixed voltage calculation for RSSI receiver signal logging</li>
	<li>use projected GPS position for waypoint calculations. This helps a lot for tight missions, such as around the barrels at AVC</li>
	<li>disable cross-tracking over last 3 meters of each mission leg, to prevent fishtailing as a waypoint is approached</li>
	<li>fixed change of speed command in missions (it was off by a factor of 100x, leading to some crazy speeds!)</li>
	<li>fixed MAVLink logging of sonar distances</li>
	<li>made it possible to change <a href="apmrover2-parameters/#Board_Orientation_AHRS_ORIENTATION" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AHRS_ORIENTATION</a> at runtime without a reboot</li>
	<li>added new <a href="apmrover2-parameters/#RCMAP__Parameters" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RCMAP_*</a> parameters to allow for having RC input channels in any order</li>
	<li>added new internal task scheduler for more accurate timing</li>
	<li>fixed HIL simulation code</li>
	<li>fixed handling of PX4 servo arming</li>
	<li>changed the <a href="apmrover2-parameters/#Auto_mode_trigger_pin_APMrover2AUTO_TRIGGER_PIN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AUTO_TRIGGER_PIN</a> to be push-on/push-off</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Meanwhile Tom and I are working towards adding the L1 navigation controller for the next release.
<ul>
	<li>We didn't put that in this release as we aren't yet happy enough with the performance. We hope to get that fixed soon!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The other thing that has changed since the last release is that we have switched to the new rover documentation site.
<ul>
	<li>The docs have improved a lot, although there is still more to do!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Happy rovering!
