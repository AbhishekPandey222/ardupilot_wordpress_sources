This article describes the main components of a Rover system, including the ground vehicle, autopilot hardware, and the software/firmware.

<h1>Rover Components</h1>

While it is is possible to build a vehicle with Rover from scratch we highly recommend starting from an existing RC vehicle (this comes with a frame, escs and power supply). You will need to add the autopilot, GPS, and possibly some other hardware. Most importantly you will need to obtain an RC Transmitter that has spare channels needed for autopilot mode control and learning.

We like cheap 4-wheel-drive off-road vehicles with brushless motors and no RC (the RC units that come with most ready-to-run RC cars don't have the spare channel needed for autopilot mode control and learning). One such good platform is <a href="http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=17791">this RC off-roader from HobbyKing</a>, which is just $72 (don't worry, we won't use the goofy plastic body shell):

<h2>Autopilot Hardware</h2>

<a href="common-pixhawk-overview/">Pixhawk</a> is highly recommended for general use.

Developers creating robot vision applications should consider using a separate Companion Computer, or a Linux based autopilot board (e.g. <a href="common-navio-overview">NAVIO+</a> or <a href="common-erle-brain-linux-autopilot">Erle-Brain</a>) which is capable of running both Rover and the image processing code.

For more options, see the topic <a href="common-choosing-a-flight-controller">Choosing a Flight Controller</a>.

[note]You will need at least four <a href="http://store.jdrones.com/Servo_Extension_15cm_Female_Female_p/cblsrvff15.htm">female-to-female servo extension cables</a> to connect the autopilot to your RC receiver (choose length to suit)[/note]

<h2>4+ channel RC transmitter and receiver</h2>

You'll need a radio control transmitter to manually control your Rover and to activate its control modes. You can use any RC transmitter/receiver system with at least 4 channels. 

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/spektrum-dx8.png"><img class="wp-image-5962" title="RC Transmitter and Receiver" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/spektrum-dx8.png" alt="RC Transmitter and Receiver" width="168" height="168" /></a>

Don't get one designed for cars (with a steering wheel and throttle trigger); we won't be driving the Rover manually much at all.  Ideally, it will have at least two toggles switches, and one of those switches will have three positions. If you're on a budget, the <a href="http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__8992__Turnigy_9X_9Ch_Transmitter_w_Module_8ch_Receiver_Mode_2_v2_Firmware_.html">Turnigy 9x</a> ($54) is a popular choice. If you'd like better quality, we like the <a href="common-pixhawk-and-px4-compatible-rc-transmitter-and-receiver-systems/#frsky_taranis_ppm-sum_compatible_transmitter">Taranis FrSky Reciever</a>.

Some other options are discussed in the topic <a href="common-pixhawk-and-px4-compatible-rc-transmitter-and-receiver-systems">Compatible RC Transmitter and Receiver Systems (Pixhawk/PX4)</a>.




<h2>GPS module</h2>

Your Rover will <em>require</em> a GPS module. The recommended module is <a href="common-installing-3dr-ublox-gps-compass-module">3DR UBlox GPS + Compass Module</a> which also includes a compass. You can check out <a href="common-positioning-landing-page">other GPS solutions here</a>.

<h2>LiPo batteries and charger</h2>

You'll also need batteries and a charger. Almost any 2S (7.2v) LiPo under 2600 mAh will do, but the recommend one for the above buggy is <a href="http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16589__Turnigy_1700mAh_2S_20C_Lipo_Pack_Suits_1_16th_Monster_Beatle_SCT_Buggy_USA_Warehouse_.html">this one</a>. A simple LiPo charger like <a href="http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__24289__Turnigy_2S_3S_Balance_Charger_Direct_110_240v_Input_USA_Warehouse_.html">this one</a> will work fine.



<h1>Optional hardware</h1>

<h2>Telemetry Radio</h2>

A <a href="common-telemetry-landingpage">telemetry radio</a> allows your Rover to communicate with your ground station remotely using the MAVLink protocol. This allows you to interact with your missions in real time and receive streaming data from your vehicle's cameras and other components. This adds considerable convenience to your missions!

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/Telemetry_store.jpg"><img class="wp-image-12806 size-medium align" title="3DR Radio Telemetry Kit" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/Telemetry_store-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

<h2>Sonar/IR Sensors</h2>

<a href="http://rover.ardupilot.com/wiki/sonar-sensors/">Sonar/IR sensors</a> are recommended for obstacle avoidance.



<h1>Ready to Use Rovers</h1>

At time of writing, the only Ready-to-Run (RTR) Rover is <a href="https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-rover/">Erle-Rover</a>.

This RTR Rover contains all the needed components for getting started: the frame, <a href="http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-brain-2/">Erle-Brain</a> Linux autopilot, 4 Channels 2.4Ghz RC, Power Module (to power up the autopilot), NIMH battery and charger.

[note]This Rover uses a powerful Linux autopilot that can run more computationally intensive operations than a traditional autopilot (like Pixhawk). [/note]


<h1>Ground Control Station</h1>

The (free and open source) <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/">Mission Planner</a> is required if you're going to be loading new versions of Rover onto the autopilot controller, and for first-time tuning and calibration. It runs on a PC and can also be used for planning missions.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/groundstation-with-MP.png"><img class="wp-image-5966" title="Ground Station with Mission Planner" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/05/groundstation-with-MP-300x214.png" alt="Ground Station with Mission Planner" width="180" height="128" /></a>

Once your Rover is configured, you may find it more convenient to choose a different ground station - running on the tablet, phone or computer of your choice. The main options are discussed in the topic <a href="common-choosing-a-ground-station">Choosing a Ground Station</a>.
