Learning mode (sort of) plus obstacle avoidance.

<ul>
	<li>Steering mode is a bit like learning mode, except that the controls use the same steering, throttle and obstacle avoidance code as AUTO mode does.
        <ul>
	    <li>The steering controls the "navigation bearing", which is what AUTO uses to navigate.</li>
	    <li>The throttle controls the target speed, just like AUTO does.</li>
	    <li>When it sees an obstacle it tries to avoid it in the same way that AUTO does.</li>
	    <li>It even does turn speed scaling.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
	<li>So you can use STEERING mode to test your rover while remaining fully in control.</li>
	<li>Drive it at a obstacle, and it will avoid it, which is not only fun, it's great for tuning.</li>
	<li>Momentary toggle (CH7) stores the current GPS position as a new waypoint.</li>
</ul>
