<h1>Rover Overview</h1>

Rover is an advanced <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/license-gplv3/">open source</a> autopilot for guiding <strong>ground vehicles</strong> and <strong>boats</strong>.  It can run fully autonomous missions that are defined using mission planning software or pre-recorded by the driver during a manual run.

Rover runs on the <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-pixhawk">Pixhawk</a> and a number of other  <a href="http://rover.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-autopilots/">supported autopilot boards</a>.

This is the platform that won the <a href="https://avc.sparkfun.com/">2013 and 2014 Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition</a>! That said, Rover is far more than just a toy - it is already being used in numerous applications (you can see a few examples including agricultural automation in our <a href="rover-video-demonstration">Video Demos</a>).
