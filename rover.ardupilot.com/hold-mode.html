All Stop.

<ul>

	<li>When you switch to Hold mode, the vehicle should stop with its wheels pointed straight ahead.</li>
	<li>It is necessary to set your throttle (<code>RC3_Trim</code>) parameter to the correct position for your vehicles throttle off PWM.</li>
	<li>If you have a reversing vehicle with a center neutral point set <code>RC3_TRIM</code> parameter to 1500: (May need adjustment for your vehicle).</li>
	<li>If you have a non reversing vehicle RC3_TRIM can be left to it's default low (~1100 PWM) setting or adjusted to it if necessary.</li>
	<li>In Auto mode if RC reception is lost, the controller will automatically switch to Hold mode.</li>
	<li>If you enable Throttle Failsafe and set the Failsafe action to HOLD it will go to HOLD if radio reception is lost in all modes.</li>
	<li>Normally you do not have to install this as a switch option.</li>
	<li>If it failsafes to HOLD mode, switching to another mode and back will clear it.</li>
</ul>
