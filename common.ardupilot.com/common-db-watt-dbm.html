We usually refer to power in Watts. So, its easy to understand when certain radio transmitter has an output of 1w.

But, why sometimes this output is given in dBm?

That's because while a signal travels through a conductive medium it loses energy.

From step to step on a range the power of the signal is attenuated on a percent applied to the resultant power from the previous step. You should notice that the loss isn't linear and will never reaches zero.

To express those non-linear steps, we use <tt>"dB"</tt> which is a logarithmic ratio. Is a function that rules the non-linear differences of each two values of power or amplitude in a range. A positive or negative difference means a gain or a loss of the signal. The unit <tt>"dB"</tt> is based on log<sub>10</sub>. The function <tt>"Log"</tt> of your scientific calculator matches the function log<sub>10</sub>(x).

The term <tt>"dBm"</tt> is how much, in dB, a value exceeds 1mW. So, 0dBm is 1mW and 1dBm is 1,259mW.

Here you can see how to do some basic calculations:

<strong>Watt to dBm</strong>

10<tt>*</tt>log<sub>10</sub>(<tt>[signal in watt]*</tt>1000)

<strong>dBm to Watt</strong>

(10^(<tt>[ratio in dBm]</tt>/10))/1000

<h3>How to use it?</h3>
When signal and medium propeties are expressed in dB or dBm all the output calculation is resumed in just addition and subtraction.

E.g.: A radio has an output of 60mW. This radio is connected to a 7m cable with atennuation of 25dB per 100m which goes to the antenna with a gain of 14dBi. What is the output power?

<strong>TX_Power</strong> -&gt; 60mW -&gt; (60 / 1000) = <strong>0.06W</strong>. By using the conversion you know it means <strong>17.78dBm</strong>

<strong>Cable_Loss</strong> -&gt; 25dB/100m -&gt; 0,25bB per meter <tt>*</tt> 7 = <strong>1.75dB</strong>

<strong>Antenna_Gain</strong> -&gt; <strong>14dBi</strong>

<strong>Output_Power</strong> = <strong>TX_Power</strong> - <strong>Cable_Loss</strong> + <strong>Antenna_Gain</strong>

<strong>Output_Power</strong> = <strong>17.78</strong> - <strong>1.75</strong> + <strong>14</strong> = <strong>30.03dB</strong>. By using the conversion you know it means <strong>1W</strong>.
