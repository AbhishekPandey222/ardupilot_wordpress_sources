[archived]APM2 with built-in GPS no longer produced.[/archived]

If you have an APM 2 with the built-in Mediatek GPS and would like to use an external and/or different GPS module, you can do so with some simple modifications:

Just solder a blob over these two pins, to short them out:

<h1>Testing</h1>
<ol>
	<li>With no external GPS, connect to APM via the Mission Planner. The HUD should report "No GPS". That's good -- it means it can't detect a GPS module. Now disconnect and remove the power from your board/remove the USB cable</li>
	<li>Connect your external GPS to the GPS port</li>
	<li>Connect the USB cable and connect via the Mission Planner again</li>
	<li>Once it connects, it should report "No Fix" (if you're indoors or don't have a fix yet) or "3D Fix" (if you've got GPS fix). Either are great -- it means your new GPS was detected!</li>
