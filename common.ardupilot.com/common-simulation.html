This page describes the options for code-testing by simulation with the ArduPilot.  Simulation allows for safe testing of experimental code and settings.  Crashing software planes is a lot cheaper than crashing real ones!

<strong>Hardware in the loop (HITL):</strong> HITL simulation replaces the plane and the environment with a simulator.  The simulator has a high-fidelity aircraft dynamics model and environment model (wind, turbulence, etc.).  The physical APM hardware is configured exactly as for flight, and connects to your computer running the simulator, rather than the aircraft.

<strong>Software in the loop (SITL):</strong> SITL simulation additionally virtualizes the APM hardware as well as the aircraft and the environment as in HITL.  SITL is useful for rapid development and when physical hardware (autopilots and ground stations) are not available or not required.
