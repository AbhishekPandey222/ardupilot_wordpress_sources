Most users should choose the <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/simulation-2/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop/">Software In The Loop (SITL) simulator</a> (dev wiki) as it can simulate Copter, Plane or Rover without the need for any vehicle hardware, and can be run on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. It is also the easiest form of simulation to set up.
