The PX4 has the following "Available" Analog input port pins which may be put to a variety of uses.

<ul>
	<li><strong>PIN = 10 High Voltage Analog pin.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Located on pin 5 of the DF13 15 pin "multi-connector" of the PX4FMU board.</li>
	<li>This pin can accept up to 18.6 volts. (You can add an additional resistor divider and set the scaling appropriately for higher voltages).</li>
	<li>With the Advanced Parameter VOLT_DIVIDER set to 1 voltage can be read directly.
<ul>
	<li>For old releases VOLT_DIVIDER needed to be set to 5.66 for direct voltage scaling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>PIN = 11 The "airspeed" pin.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Located on pin 2 of the 3 pin "FMU-PRS" DF13 connector on the PX4IO board.</li>
	<li>Generally used in APM:Plane for the Air Speed Sensor with VCC on pin 1, Sensor on pin 2 and Ground on pin 3.
<ul>
	<li>APM:Plane Advanced Parameter: ASPD_PIN set to 11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>This pin is directly connected to the ADC on the PX4FMU.</li>
	<li>This pin can accept up to 6.6 volts (it has an internal voltage divider).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>PIN = 12 A general analog input pin.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Located on pin 3 of the "FMU-SPI" port on the PX4IO board.</li>
	<li>Commonly used for Sonar
<ul>
	<li>APM:Copter and APM:Rover Advanced Parameter: SONAR_PIN set to 12</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>This pin is directly connected to the ADC on the PX4FMU.</li>
	<li>This pin can accept up to 3.3 volts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>PIN = 13 A general analog input pin.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Located on pin 4 of the "FMU-SPI" port on the PX4IO board.</li>
	<li>Commonly used for Sonar 2 in dual Sonar installations.
<ul>
	<li>APM:Rover Advanced Parameter: SONAR2_PIN set to 13</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>This pin is directly connected to the ADC on the PX4FMU.</li>
	<li>This pin can accept up to 3.3 volts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>PIN = 100 A virtual analog input pin for voltage of a battery connected to the 6V to 18V input of the PX4IO voltage regulator.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This is the normal pin to use for LiPo monitoring on the PX4IO.</li>
	<li>If using this pin then set VOLT_DIVIDER to 1 for correct battery voltage reading.</li>
	<li>Virtual "pin" 100's input comes only from the battery power in jack on the PX4IO board.</li>
	<li>This "pin" is not brought out for separate user access.</li>
	<li>This pin is separate from the Pin 10 high voltage analog pin on the PX4FMU listed above which can also be used as a battery voltage monitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>PIN = 101 A virtual analog input pin for a battery current sensor connected to the "current" pin next to the power connector on the PX4IO.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This pin can accept up to 3.3 volts.</li>
	<li>WARNING: If voltages higher than 3.3 are used there is a risk of causing the PX4IO to malfunction, forcing the PX4FMU to reboot.</li>
	<li>For use with a current sensor, a 0.1uF capacitor between this pin and ground will help reduce "noise".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The battery voltage and current reading tasks can be assigned to any analog pins.
<ul>
	<li>The "virtual" pins 100 and 101 are actually measured on the PX4IO microcontroller, and are presented to the APM code on the FMU board via those virtual pin numbers.</li>
	<li>You can set the BATT_VOLT_PIN parameter to any of the analog input pins on the PX4 listed in the wiki.</li>
	<li>All of them will give you a result in volts, automatically scaling for the right scaling factor on that input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>For example:
<ul>
	<li>If you have an external voltage monitor that outputs 0 to 5V and you are not using the airspeed pin for an airspeed sensor.</li>
	<li>Then you are probably best off connecting your voltage monitor to the airspeed input and setting BATT_VOLT_PIN=11.</li>
	<li>That will give you an input that can take up to 6.6V.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Similarly you can use any of the analog inputs for current, by setting the BATT_CURR_PIN parameter.</li>
	<li>So you really just need to match up your sensors voltage output range to the input that best fits and then use that one.
<ul>
	<li>Just make sure your sensor won't give a voltage above the rated range of the input.</li>
	<li>(Or include a resistor divider to make sure it doesn't.)</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
