ArduPilot runs on many different flight controller boards, the most important of which are linked from the topic <a href="common-autopilots">AutoPilot Hardware Options</a>.

Selecting the right board depends on the physical restraints of the vehicle and the applications that you want to run. Broadly speaking:
<ul>
<li><a href="common-pixhawk-overview/">Pixhawk</a> is highly recommended for general use.</li>
<li><a href="common-pixracer-overview">Pixracer</a> is recommended for small frames that require no more than 6 PWM outputs.</li>
<li><a href="common-px4fmu-overview">PX4</a> is recommended in very small/fast vehicles (it is much smaller than Pixhawk).</li>
<li><a href="common-navio-overview">NAVIO+</a> or <a href="common-erle-brain-linux-autopilot">Erle-Brain</a> Linux Autopilots should be considered for UAV Vision applications.</li>
</ul>

[tip]There are also numerous clones and minor variants of the boards linked above. Many of these may be perfectly capable replacements.[/tip]

[note]The APM2.6 board is no longer supported for Copter or Plane. The last firmware builds that can be installed are AC v3.2.1 and Plane 3.3.0.[/note]
