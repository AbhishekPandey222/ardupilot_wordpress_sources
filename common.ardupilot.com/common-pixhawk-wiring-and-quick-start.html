[warning]Do not connect any servos to the direct PWM outputs of your receiver. The RCIN port on the Pixhawk is designed for low power devices only, and a servo may draw a lot of current when moving rapidly. If you connect a servo directly onto your receiver while the receiver is powered from the RCIN port of your Pixhawk you may damage your Pixhawk.[/warning]

<h1>Power Pixhawk</h1>

Pixhawk is typically powered via its "power" port, as shown in the picture below. The power port simultaneously powers Pixhawk and reads voltage and current analog measurements produced by an optional power module. Information about powering the Pixhawk can be found in the topic <a href="common-powering-the-pixhawk">Powering the Pixhawk</a>.

<h1>Connect remote control inputs</h1>

Pixhawk is compatible with PPM remote control (RC) receivers, Futaba S.Bus receivers, and Spektrum DSM,DSM2, and DSM-X Satellite receivers. For traditional single-wire-per-channel (PWM) receivers a PPM encoder can be used to convert the receiver outputs to PPM-SUM.  Information about compatible receivers and how they are connected can be found in <a href="common-pixhawk-and-px4-compatible-rc-transmitter-and-receiver-systems" target="_blank">this wiki page</a>.

<h1>Connect buzzer and safety switch</h1>

The buzzer and safety switch button are mandatory for Pixhawk. Connect to the BUZZER and SWITCH ports, respectively.

<h1>3DR GPS+Compass</h1>

The <a href="common-positioning-landing-page/common-installing-3dr-ublox-gps-compass-module">3DR UBlox GPS + Compass Module</a> is the recommended GPS for Pixhawk on ArduPilot.  The GPS ports are connected with the six-position DF13 cable, and the MAG port is connected to the I2C port with the four-position DF13 cable.
