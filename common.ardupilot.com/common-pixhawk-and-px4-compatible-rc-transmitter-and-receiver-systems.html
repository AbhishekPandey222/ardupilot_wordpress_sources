This article provides an overview of the RC Transmitter and Receiver Systems that can be used with Pixhawk (and PX4) along with guidance on how they are connected.
<!-- more -->

<h1>Overview</h1>

Pixhawk is compatible with PPM RC receivers, Futaba S.Bus receivers, and Spektrum DSM,DSM2, and DSM-X Satellite receivers. 

For traditional single-wire-per-channel (PWM) receivers a <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/ppm-encoder" target="_blank">PPM encoder</a> can be used to convert the receiver outputs to PPM-SUM.



<h1>Connecting the receiver</h1>

To connect a PPM receiver, Futaba S.Bus receiver, or PPM encoder, connect the black ground, red power and white signal wires to the RC pins. These S.BUS receivers have been tested and are known to work: R2008SB, R6008SB.

<h1>Radio systems that support PPM-Sum or S-Bus directly</h1>

This section list radio systems that support PPM-Sum or S-Bus directly.

<h2>FRSKY Taranis PPM-Sum Compatible Transmitter</h2>

[tip]This solution is <strong>very highly recommended</strong> for all RC uses[/tip]

The <a title="&quot;" href="http://www.frsky-rc.com/product/pro.php?pro_id=113">FRSky Taranis RC Transmitter</a> is a very high quality open source RC Transmitter that is compatible with a wide variety of high quality FrSky PPM-Sum compatible receivers.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/01/FRSkyTaranis.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11140" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/01/FRSkyTaranis.jpg" alt="FRSkyTaranis" width="560" height="372" /></a>

[note]This transmitter is a real bargain. At time of writing they are in short supply and hard to find. Currently in the US <strong><a href="http://www.rangevideo.com/en/radios-and-receivers/96-frsky-taranis-24ghz-rc-system.html">Range Video</a></strong> has them in stock and <strong><a>Aloft Hobbies</a></strong> should be getting them in stock also.[/note]


<h2>FRSky Delta 8 MultiProtocol PPM-Sum Receiver</h2>

<ul>
	<li>This PPM-Sum compatible<strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal"> <a title="&quot;" href="http://www.valuehobby.com/frysky-delta-8.html">FRSky Delta 8 Receiver</a></strong> is multi-platform capable including Hitec Aurora 9 and Futaba RC transmitters.</li>
	<li>For an Aurora 9, install a jumper between receiver signal pins 6 and 7 (Hitec AFHSS) and pins 3 and 4 (CPPM mode) in order to bind.</li>
	<li><strong style="font-style: normal;color: #000000">Note:</strong> For a Hitec Aurora 9 system you need to have version 3.01 or later of the firmware in the transmitter's AFHSS 2.4ghz module.
<ul>
	<li>If your module does not have version 3.01 or later firmware you will need the Hitec HPP-22 programmer module in order to upgrade it.</li>
	<li>Upgrade both the AFHSS 2.4ghz module and the transmitter itself to the latest versions following<a href="http://hitecrcd.co.kr/tester/hpp_22.htm"> <strong>HP-22 online instructions</strong></a>.</li>
	<li>If the transmitter's AFHSS module's blue LED will not illuminate during binding you will need to perform this firmware upgrade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I am using the Delta 8 successfully with a PX4 and an Aurora 9, I had to complete the firmware upgrade procedure before I could bind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Futaba Transmitter Compatible With Futaba S-Bus Receivers</h2>

Futaba S.BUS2 receivers are supported since Copter/Plane 3.2. The SBUS receiver must be connected to the PPM input, not the adjacent SBUS output.

The list of supported receivers for the Pixhawk (or a PX4FMU in combination with a PX4IO board) is given below:

<ul>
	<li>Futaba / Robbe <a href="http://www.gpdealera.com/cgi-bin/wgainf100p.pgm?I=FUTL7675">R7008SB</a> S.BUS 2 Receiver</li>

<h2>Further notes on S-Bus / S-Bus 2 compatibility</h2>

In addition to the receivers discussed in the <a href="#futaba_transmitter_compatible_with_futaba_s-bus_receivers">Futaba Transmitter Compatible With Futaba S-Bus Receivers</a> section above, we have anecdotal information that a number of other receivers are also compatible (see discussion <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/drones-discuss/OpbxcBxkk8c">Current state of SBus compatibility?</a> on drones-discuss mailing list). 

These include:
<ul>
	<li>FrSky X4, X6 and X8 Receivers on SBUS.</li>
	<li>Delta 8 FRSky receiver</li>
	<li>X8R receivers (non-EU versions) with OpenTX -Taranis X9D, via the receiver SBUS out on the receiver to RCIN on the PixHawk.</li>
	<li>OrangeRX R800 receiver that also has SBUS output, with both a Spektrum DX9 and also a Taranis X9D with OrangeRX transmitter module.</li>
	<li>DX8 with OrangeRX R800 and also the Lemon RX 8-channel PPM</li>
	<li>OrangeRX DSM receivers</li>
</ul>


[tip]The parameter to enable the SBUS output from the PixHawk is BRD_SBUS_OUT.[/tip]


<h1>Spektrum Satellite Receivers Operate on PPM-Sum</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Although Spektrum main receivers do not communicate by PPM-Sum their range extending "satellite" receivers do.</li>
	<li>So it is feasible to use a single <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal"><a href="http://www.amainhobbies.com/product_info.php/cPath/61_435/products_id/199408/n/Spektrum-DSMX-Remote-Receiver">Spektrum Satellite Receiver</a></strong> to act as a PPM-Sum receiver with PX4 and Pixhawk.
<ul>
	<li>Simply pre-bind the Spektrum Satellite to your transmitter using a conventional Spektrum receiver with satellite attached.</li>
	<li>Then connect the tiny Spektrum Satellite receiver to the special "Spektrum" connector on either the PX4IO or Pixhawk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Currently satellites only work with the Spektrum DX7 and DX8 transmitters, Transmitters with more channels are (in progress).</li>
	<li>Please note that you can use a Spektrum Satellite receiver with Pixhawk or PX4 if you bind it to the transmitter using a main Spektrum receiver module. It is not currently supported to bind the Satellite receiver directly to the transmitter while the receiver is connected to the Pixhawk or PX4.</li>
	<li>Being a satellite, range is limited with this configuration and the preceding receivers and methods will provide greater range.</li>
</ul>

<h1>3DR PPM encoder and 3DR telemetry radio</h1>

The <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/ppm-encoder">3DR PPM Encoder</a> will allow you to use any Conventional RC receiver. Both the new and previous versions of the <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/ppm-encoder">3DR PPM-Sum encoder</a> are shown below:
[caption id="attachment_1947" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/01/PPM_cables_-_Copy.jpg"><img src="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/01/PPM_cables_-_Copy-300x200.jpg" alt="Newest 3DR PPM-Sum encoder" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-1947" /></a> Newest 3DR PPM-Sum encoder[/caption]
[caption id="attachment_11128" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/01/PPMEncoderDesc.jpg"><img src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/01/PPMEncoderDesc-300x146.jpg" alt="Original 3DR PPM-Sum encoder" width="300" height="146" class="size-medium wp-image-11128" /></a> Original 3DR PPM-Sum encoder[/caption]

There are some downsides of using this encoder:
<ul>
	<li>The 3DR PPM Encoder does require quite a bit of additional wiring to the receiver.</li>
	<li>It uses quite a bit of power making it likely you will need to plug in your battery while doing radio setup with USB cable in Mission Planner.</li>
	<li>The 3DR encoder also costs as much or more than several of the available PPM-Sum receivers including the FRSky Delta 8 below.</li>
</ul>

There is addition information <a href="common-ppm-encoder">about connecting and configuring the encoder here</a>.

<h2>Using the 3DR PPM Sum encoder in a system</h2>

The diagram below shows how to use the original 3DR PPM-Sum encoder. The new encoder is used in the same way.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/PX4FMU_PX4IO_Wire_3DRradio2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9918" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/PX4FMU_PX4IO_Wire_3DRradio2.jpg" alt="PX4FMU_PX4IO_Wire_3DRradio2" width="1035" height="755" /></a>



<h2>Using a Standard RC Radio Receiver with 3DR PPM Encoder</h2>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>You can use a standard radio receiver with an 8 channel PPM Encoder in place of the PPM-SUM receiver.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>An 8 Channel PPM Encoder is available from 3DRobotics <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/ppm-encoder"> Here!</a></li>
	<li>Solder a 3x8 Right angle connector from the top into one end of the 8 Channel PPM Encoder board.</li>
	<li>With the 3x8 connector up and facing away from you, solder a 3x1 Right angle connector on the right edge of the 8 Channel PPM Encoder board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Connect 5-8 output channels of your receiver to the inputs of the 8 Channel Encoder (signal wire furthest from board) with 5-8 female to female servo jumpers.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Connect the PPM-SUM output of the Encoder with a 3 wire cable to the PX4IO boards PPM sum input (1x3 connector).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>[note]If you are using a 3DR PPM Encoder it is important to know that when you are calibrating your transmitter you will quite likely need to hook up your flight battery to the PX4IO because the USB port alone can't supply enough power.[/note]</li>
