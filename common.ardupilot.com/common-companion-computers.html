<h1>Overview</h1>

Companion Computers travel on the vehicle and communicate with (and control) the flight controller. The companion computer gets all the MAVLink data produced by the autopilot (including GPS data) and can use it to make intelligent decisions during flight. This enables a broad range of functionality, from computer mediated flight paths, though to  very CPU intensive functionality such as vision processing. 

[note]The term "Companion Computer" is typically taken to mean an on-board Linux-based computer, running <a href="http://python.dronekit.io/">DroneKit-Python</a> or ROS, and communicating with the autopilot over a fast link using MAVLink messages.
&nbsp;
Using a companion computer is an alternative to using a fully integrated Linux autopilot.[/note]

This page is for plug and play solutions that require little configuration or setup (see <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/companion-computers/">Companion Computers</a> (dev wiki) for developer-focused options).
