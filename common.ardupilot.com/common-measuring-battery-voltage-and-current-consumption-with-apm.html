This page explains how to set up the 3DR Power Module (PM) to measure battery voltage and current consumption. The information will also be useful for setting up other types of Power Module.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Pixhawk and APM 2.x have a dedicated connector for attaching the <a title="3DR Power Module" href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/apm-power-module-with-xt60-connectors" target="_blank">3DR Power Module</a> (PM). This is useful because it:
<ul>

	<li>Provides a stable 5.37V and 2.25Amp power supply which reduces the chances of a brown-out</li>
	<li>Allows monitoring of the battery's voltage and current and triggering a return-to-launch when the voltage becomes low or the total power consumed during the flight approaches the battery's capacity</li>
	<li>Allows the autopilot firmware to more accurately compensate for the interference on the compass from other components</li>
</ul>

The PM accepts a maximum input voltage of 18V (up to 4S Lipo battery) and maximum current of 90Amps. When used with an APM the full 90Amp current sensing range can be used, with the PX4/Pixhawks up to 60Amps can be measured.

There is more general information on powering in <a href="common-powering-the-pixhawk">Powering the Pixhawk</a>.

[warning]The Power Module's maximum input voltage is 18V. This is the maximum allowed by the on-board regulator. (4 cell LiPo max).[/warning][warning]The Power Module does not have sufficient power for servos or high current devices such as FPV transmitters.
<ul>
	<li>The power module does provide sufficient power for the Pixhawk/APM, your receiver and a small electronic module such as a PPM encoder or 3DR telemetry radio.</li>
	<li>You may "control" servos from signal pins, but the servos must be powered by a separate ESC.</li>
</ul>[/warning]



<h1>Connecting the PM to a flight controller board</h1>

The 6-pos cable plugs into the 6-pos connector on both the Power Module and Pixhawk/APM.

Your battery connects to the Power Module's male connector, and its female connector plugs into your ESC or Power Distribution Board.



[note]<strong>APM 2.x Power Module Notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You should normally remove the APM's JP1 jumper when using the Power Module so that only your APM board and your receiver are powered from the Power Module's on-board regulator and not from your ESCs.
<ul>
	<li>Removing the jumper allows you to use the APM's servo output rail to distribute power from your ESC's BEC or separate UBEC to any servos or external equipment.</li>
	<li>If you are using servos, plug an ESC BEC or stand alone UBEC power wire and ground wire into two of the power and ground pins on the APM's servo output rail to provide a common power and ground bus for servo power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You can leave the jumper present if you are using ESCs that have no BECs or if all the ESC BECs power wires are cut and you are not powering any servos from the servo out rail.</li>
	<li>You can also individually power each servo from each individual ESC-BEC.
<ul>
	<li>Simply run the power and ground from each ESC-BEC individually and directly to each servo (very handy for multicopters).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Setup through Mission Planner</h1>

Battery measurement is set up in the Mission Planner's <strong>INITIAL SETUP | Optional Hardware | Battery Monitor</strong> screen

[caption id="attachment_4531" align="alignnone" width="1025"]<a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/06/MissionPlanner_BatteryMonitorConfiguration.png"><img src="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/06/MissionPlanner_BatteryMonitorConfiguration.png" alt="MissionPlanner: Battery Monitor Configuration" width="1025" height="621" class="size-full wp-image-4531" /></a> MissionPlanner: Battery Monitor Configuration[/caption]

<ol>
  <li>Enable voltage and current sensing by selecting:
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Voltage and Current</li>
	<li><strong>Sensor:</strong> 3DR Power Module</li>
	<li><strong>APM ver:</strong> Pixhawk (or whatever board you are using)</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Capacity:</strong> Fill in the your battery capacity in mAh</li>
    </ul>



</li>
  <li>Low Battery Alert from ground station:
  <ul>	
    <li>If you wish the <em>Mission Planner</em> to alert you verbally when your battery is low check the "MP Alert on Low Battery" checkbox and enter the warning you wish to hear (it will be read out by a computerized voice), the voltage level and finally the percentage of remaining current.

  </ul>

<h1>Calibrating the voltage reading</h1>

You can check that the APM/PX4 is correctly measuring the voltage of the battery by:
<ol>
	<li>Check the voltage of your lipo battery with a hand-held volt meter or a <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__10080__Turnigy_130A_Watt_Meter_and_Power_Analyzer.html" target="_blank">power analyzer</a></li>
	<li>Connect your APM/PX4 to your computer and plug in the lipo battery</li>
	<li>Check the voltage through the mission planner's <strong>INITIAL SETUP | Optional Hardware | Battery Monitor</strong> screen or on the Flight Data screen's HUD or <em>Status</em> tab.
<a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/06/MPCheckVoltage.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-680" src="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/06/MPCheckVoltage-300x191.png" alt="MPCheckVoltage" width="300" height="191" /></a>
</li>
</ol>


If you find the voltage is not correct (i.e. if off from the hand-held volt meter's reading by more than perhaps 0.2V) you can correct the APM/PX4's reading by doing the following:
<ol>
	<li>On the mission planner's <strong>INITIAL SETUP | Optional Hardware | Battery Monitor</strong> screen set the "Sensor" to "Other".</li>
	<li>Enter the voltage according to the hand-held volt meter in the "Measured Battery Voltage" field</li>
	<li>Press tab or click out of the field and the "Voltage Divider (Calced)" value will update and the "Battery voltage (Calced)" should now equal the measured voltage

<h1>Connecting power module to alternative pins</h1> 

The above connection information assumes assumes the power module will be plugged into the default port on the flight controller (ie. Pixhawk). If you wish to change where the power module is plugged into the controller, the pins used can be modified using the BATT_VOLT_PIN and BATT_CURR_PIN parameters.

The list of available analog input pins that can be used are listed on the Hardware Options page for each board (<a href="common-pixhawk-overview/#pixhawk_analog_input_pins_virtual_pin_firmware_mapped_pin_id">Pixhawk</a>, <a href="common-apm25-and-26-overview/#analog_input_pins">APM2</a>).
