<h1>Parts Required</h1>

Aside from Zubax GNSS itself and the Pixhawk it will be connected to, the following parts are needed:
<ul>
	<li>A <strong>UAVCAN Micro to DF13 adapter cable</strong></li>
	<li>A <strong>UAVCAN Micro termination plug</strong> (two plugs if the bus is doubly redundant)</li>
</ul>

Also, in order to configure the board, either of these tools is needed:
<ul>
	<li>A <strong>USB-UART bridge with a CLIK-Mate connector</strong> - for configuring via the Auxiliary Serial Port</li>
	<li>A PC CAN adapter, e.g., 8devices USB2CAN - for configuring via UAVCAN</li>
</ul>

The parts listed above in bold font can be purchased from <a href="http://zubax.com/sales-network">Zubax distributors</a>.


<h1>Configuring Pixhawk with ArduPilot firmware</h1>

UAVCAN is supported in the following ArduPilot firmwares:
<ul>
	<li>ArduPlane 3.2.1 and newer</li>
	<li>ArduCopter 3.3rc1 and newer</li>
</ul>


UAVCAN driver is enabled in ArduPilot by default, but it is necessary to change some configuration parameters to make ArduPilot listen to external UAVCAN-connected sensors (Zubax GNSS in this case). The following sections assume that Mission Planner is installed on the user's computer, and that Pixhawk is otherwise properly configured. 

Remember to restart Pixhawk after making the changes.

<h2>GPS</h2>

In order to make ArduPilot receive measurements from an UAVCAN-interfaced GNSS receiver, set the parameter <code>GPS_TYPE</code> to 9.

<h2>Compass</h2>

In order to make ArduPilot receive measurements from an UAVCAN-interfaced compass, open the tab <strong>INITIAL SETUP</strong>, then select <strong>Mandatory Hardware → Compass</strong>. On the displayed page:

<ul>
	<li>Check the checkbox <strong>Enable</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <em>Orientation </em>frame, select the option <strong>Manual</strong>, <strong>ROTATION_NONE</strong>. You may need to select a different rotation if the arrow printed on Zubax GNSS is not aligned with vehicle's longitudinal axis.</li>
</ul>

Don't forget to perform compass calibration when done.


<h2>Barometer</h2>

ArduPilot does not have proper support for external barometers, so proposed solution is a bit hackish, but it still works. This modification is not required if external barometer is not needed. Also, make sure that barometer is enabled on Zubax GNSS.

Power off the Pixhawk, extract its microSD card and mount it on a computer. Create a file <em>etc/rc.txt</em> on the card and put the following script in it:

<pre># uORB will be started again by the main init script later, it's OK.


if uorb start
then
    echo "ext: uORB started"
    if uavcan start 1
    then
        echo "ext: UAVCAN started"
    else
        echo "ext: Could not start UAVCAN"
    fi
else
    echo "ext: Could not start uORB"
fi

 
# This delay allows UAVCAN to pick external sensors before internal ones
sleep 2
</pre>

Insert the card back into Pixhawk.

Done, now the Pixhawk will be using barometer installed on Zubax GNSS, provided that Zubax GNSS was connected to the bus at the time of boot; otherwise it will fall back to internal barometer.



<h1>Configuring Zubax GNSS</h1>

The default configuration should be changed as follows:
<ul>
	<li>The parameter uavcan_node_id needs to be set to an appropriate unique value to avoid Node ID conflicts</li>
	<li>Possibly, some functionality that is disabled by default needs to be enabled (such as the time synchronization master or the air data sensor)</li>
</ul>


There are two ways to alter the configuration: via Auxiliary Serial Port, or via UAVCAN. Both are described below.

<h2>Via Auxiliary Serial Port</h2>

<a href="http://docs.zubax.com/Auxiliary_Serial_Port_Interface#Communication">Connect the interface, open CLI</a>, then execute:
<pre> > cfg set uavcan_node_id 50</pre>

This command will set the Node ID to 50.

Save the configuration into the non-volatile memory:
<pre> > cfg save</pre>

An error like <code>ublox: Invalid checksum</code> may appear, which is expected because non-volatile memory IO disrupts other IO operations.

Now, restart the device in order to apply the new parameters:
<pre> > reset</pre>

Configuration is complete.



<h2>Via UAVCAN</h2>
The following steps need to be performed:
<ul>
	<li>Change the configuration parameters using the service <code>uavcan.protocol.param.GetSet</code></li>
	<li>Save the parameters into the non-volatile memory using the <code>service uavcan.protocol.param.SaveErase</code></li>
	<li>Restart the node using the service <code>uavcan.protocol.RestartNode</code></li>
</ul>


Under Linux, these steps can be easily performed with <strong>uavcan_nodetool</strong> as described in this section.

Start the <a href="http://uavcan.org/Libuavcan_platform_documentation:_Linux#uavcan_nodetool">uavcan_nodetool</a> (assuming that the CAN interface name is can0):
<pre>$ uavcan_nodetool 127 can0</pre>
Tip: Under Linux 3.9 or newer, with 8devices USB2CAN, the interface can0 can be brought up using a command like: ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000 sample-point 0.875
<strong>uavcan_nodetool</strong> should open its internal command prompt. Assuming that the Node ID needs to be changed from 1 (default) to 50, enter the following command:
<pre> > param 1 uavcan_node_id 50 </pre>

[tip]Execute <code>help</code> to get usage info[/tip]
The output should look roughly like this:
<pre>
Name                                     Value          Default        Min            Max
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uavcan_node_id                           50             1              1              125
</pre>
Now, save the configuration:
<pre> > param_save 1</pre>

Restart the node:
<pre> > restart 1</pre>
Now, make sure that the node is available at the newly set Node ID:
<pre> > info 50</pre>

Configuration is complete. Press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> to stop the application.

<h1>Connecting</h1>

Since Zubax GNSS can be powered directly from the bus, the electrical connections are quite simple:
<ul>
	<li>Connect Zubax GNSS with Pixhawk using the <a href="#parts_required">appropriate cable for your configuration</a>. In case you're using a non-redundant CAN interface (which is the only available option for Pixhawk v1), you can use either of the interfaces on the Zubax GNSS, leaving the second one unconnected.</li>
	<li>Insert the termination plug into another connector of the used CAN interface on the Zubax GNSS.</li>
</ul>

Now the setup is ready to work.
