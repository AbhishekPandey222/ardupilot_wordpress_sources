<h1>Comparison of PX4-FMU-IO and Pixhawk</h1>

The new PX4 <a href="https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/px4/modules/pixhawk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pixhawk module</a> is an evolution of the existing <a href="https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/px4/modules/px4fmu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FMU</a> and <a href="https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/px4/modules/px4io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IO</a> modules and is completely compatible.
<ul>
	<li>The PX4 FMU and IO stack is very small (the size of an 8 ch RC receiver) and very densely packed, Pixhawk has more space, more serial ports and more PWM outputs.</li>
	<li>There are two groups of servo connectors, one main group of 8 outputs wired through the backup processor, and an auxiliary group of 6 outputs directly wired to the main processor.</li>
	<li>The port labeled "RC" can take normal PPM sum or Futaba S.Bus inputs and the port labeled "SB" can read RSSI our output S.Bus to servos.</li>
	<li>A Spektrum satellite compatible port is on top (labeled SPKT/DSM).</li>
	<li>The basic operation is the same, and the software is shared.</li>
	<li>Inside Pixhawk a FMUv2 and an IOv2 do their duties on a single board (and developers will find that the software will refer to FMUv2 and IOv2)</li>
	<li>The PX4 / Pixhawk system has more than 10 times the CPU performance and memory of the APM and a lot more as well.</li>
	<li>14 PWM outputs (Pixhawk) vs. 12 PWM outputs (PX4)</li>
	<li>All Pixhawk PWM outputs on servo connectors (PX4: 8 on servo, 4 on 15 pin DF13 connector)</li>
	<li>5 serial ports vs. 4 (with some double functionality, so only 3 in some configurations on old version)</li>
	<li>256 KB RAM and 2 MB flash vs 192 KB RAM and 1 MB flash (old)</li>
	<li>Modernized sensor suite (latest generation)</li>
	<li>High-power buzzer driver (old: VBAT driven, not as loud)</li>
	<li>High-power multicolor led (old: only external BlinkM support)</li>
	<li>Support for panel-mounted USB extension (old: not present)</li>
	<li>Revised, improved power architecture</li>
	<li>Better protection on all input / output pins against shorts and over voltage</li>
	<li>Better sensing of power rails (internal and external, e.g. servo voltage)</li>
	<li>Support for Spektrum Satellite pairing (needed some manual wiring work in v1, but also software-supported)</li>
	<li>No more solid state relays on v2 (was not really used)</li>
	<li>Connectors easier to disconnect in case, as the surrounding plastic helps to place the fingers correctly (more on this in a separate post)</li>
	<li>Case prevents one-off failure operation of servo connectors</li>
	<li>The new unit is consirably larger, has the same height, but offers in general more handling convenience.</li>
	<li>External power supply similar to existing 3DR power brick (every unit comes with a free module).</li>
	<li>Both generations offer the same backup / override processor that allows failover to manual if the autopilot fails in fixed wing setups.</li>
	<li>For software developers the differences are nicely abstracted in the PX4 middleware, and can be sensed / configured at runtime.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pixhawk analog input pins</h1>

This section lists the analog pins available on the Pixhawk. These are virtual pins, defined in the firmware.

<strong>Virtual Pin 2 and Power connector Pin 4 and Virtual Pin 2</strong>: power management connector voltage pin, accepts up to 3.3V, usually attached to 3DR power brick with 10.1:1 scaling

<strong>Virtual Pin 3 and Power connector Pin 3</strong>: power management connector current pin, accepts up to 3.3V, usually attached to 3DR power brick with 17:1 scaling

<strong>Virtual Pin 4 and (No connector Pin)</strong>: VCC 5V rail sensing. This virtual pin reads the voltage on the 5V supply rail. It is used to provide the HWSTATUS.Vcc reading that ground stations use to display 5V status

<strong>Virtual Pin 13 and ADC 3.3V connector Pin 4</strong>: This takes a max of 3.3V. May be used for sonar or other analog sensor.

<strong>Virtual Pin 14 and ADC 3.3V connector Pin 2</strong>: This takes a max of 3.3V. May be used for second sonar or other analog sensor.

<strong>Virtual Pin 15 and ADC 6.6V connector Pin 2</strong>: analog airspeed sensor port. This has 2:1 scaling builtin, so can take up to 6.6v analog inputs. Usually used for analog airspeed, but may be used for analog sonar or other analog sensors.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/pixhawk1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11421" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/pixhawk1-212x300.jpg" alt="pixhawk1" width="212" height="300" /></a>

<strong>Virtual Pin 102</strong>: Servo power rail voltage. This is an internal measurement of the servo rail voltage made by the IO board within the Pixhawk. It has 3:1 scaling, allowing it to measure up to 9.9V.

<strong>Virtual Pin 103</strong>: RSSI (Received Signal Strength Input) input pin voltage (SBus connector output pin). This is the voltage measured by the RSSI input pin on the SBUS-out connector (the bottom pin of the 2nd last servo connector on the 14 connector servo rail). Can alternatively serve as SBus out but not yet implemented.
<a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/01/pixhawk2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1718" src="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/01/pixhawk2-300x161.jpg" alt="pixhawk2" width="300" height="161" /></a>


<h1>Pixhawk digital inputs</h1>

The Pixhawk digital output pins on the FMU servo rail (the "AUX" pins) can also be used as digital input pins, using the same pin numbers as are used for outputs. This can be used for options that allow for digital input pins, such as the AUTO_TRIGGER_PIN in APM:Rover.

The same rules for setting up BRD_PWM_COUNT apply for digital inputs and digital outputs.


<h1>Pixhawk digital outputs (Virtual Pins 50 - 55)</h1>

The Pixhawk has no dedicated digital output pins on its DF13 connectors, but you can assign up to 6 of the "AUX SERVO" connectors to be digital outputs. These are the first 6 of the 14 three-pin servo connectors on the end of the board. They are marked as AUX servo pins 1 - 6 on the silkscreen as seen above.

To set the number of these pins that are available as digital outputs, set the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter. On Pixhawk this defaults to 4, which means the first 4 AUX connectors are for servos (PWM) and the last 2 are for digital outputs. If you set BRD_PWM_COUNT to 0 then you would have 6 digital outputs and still have 8 PWM outputs on the rest of the connector.

The 6 possible pins are available for PIN variables as pin numbers 50 to 55 inclusive. So if you have BRD_PWM_COUNT at the default value of 4, then the two digital output pins will be pin numbers 54 and 55.

In summary:

If BRD_PWM_CNT= 2 then
50 = RC9
51 = RC10
52 = Aux 3
53 = Aux 4
54 = Aux 5
55 = Aux 6

If BRD_PWM_CNT= 4 then
50 = RC9
51 = RC10
52 = RC11
53 = RC12
54 = Aux 5
55 = Aux 6

If BRD_PWM_CNT= 6 then
50 = RC9
51 = RC10
52 = RC11
53 = RC12
54 = RC13
55 = RC14



<h1>Powering</h1>

<a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/06/pixhawkpower-port.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2310" src="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/06/pixhawkpower-port-196x300.jpg" alt="pixhawkpower port" width="196" height="300" /></a>
Pixhawk should primarily be powered via its power port as shown in the picture above,  The power port simultaneously powers Pixhawk and reads voltage and current analog measurements produced by an optional 3DR power module (or other voltage/current measurement devices such as an Attopilot). To power Pixhawk off the servo rail without a power module, connect a servo or BEC to a power (+) pin and a ground (-) pin of the main outputs. When powering Pixhawk off the servo rail, we recommend adding a Zener diode (part number 1N5339) to condition the power across the rail and prevent it from becoming too high. This method (with Zener diode) can also be used as backup power for Pixhawk when using a power module, so in the case of a failure on the power module, Pixhawk will take power from the output rail. See the voltage ratings below for more information on powering Pixhawk. Note: The Zener diode should not be used with servos with more than 5V.Digital servos can feed up to 11v into the servo rail when powered off an external 5.1v bec.<strong>Pixhawk does not supply power to the servo rail</strong>.

The block diagram above synthesizes an overview of Pixhawk's power and ESC wiring,  <em>Diagram acronyms: PDB = Power Distribution Board. PM = pixhawk power port. PM/Atto = optional power module from 3DR or Attopilot alternative for higher than 4S battery voltages. </em> In this diagram, a 3DR power module (or equivalent device) power Pixhawk through its power port (primary source). One power source is enough but obviously not redundant if the power module fails to power this primary source. Therefore we have represented on the diagram a second backup power source via a 5V BEC that wires to Pixhawk's output servo rail. If the primary source fails, Pixhawk will automatically switch to this second power source. 

<strong>Advanced configuration </strong>: triple redundant power sources (power module as primary , plus two backup BECs - instead of one- to power Pixhawk's servo rail): A simple Tie bus circuit can be used to make the secondary power source redundant ! (therefore the power module can fail, a secondary BEC can fail while the third BEC will take over). In this scheme, a simple MBR1545CT integrated circuit is used. This circuit takes two BEC on its inputs and outputs only of of the two BEC according to the highest voltage (i.e. if BEC1 outputs 5.25V and BEC2 outputs 5.45V, MBR1545CT will pass BEC2 and blocks BEC1). Here a tie bus circuit wiring diagram and example realisation with the MBR1545CT integrated circuit and a 6 pin JST connector:

<strong>Wiring recommendations: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Always connect a ground reference wire with your ESC's signal wires on pixhawk servo rail (output ports 1-8). Indeed an ESC's signal wire should never be left floating without its ground reference (THERE IS NO SETUP WHICH WOULDN'T REQUIRE SIGNAL GROUND TO BE CONNECTED).</li>
	<li>It is dangerous to power the Pixhawk <strong>only </strong>from the servo rail, especially with digital servos. Servos may cause voltage spikes (as shown on illlustration below that shows the servo rail voltage on an oscilloscope when a single digital servo attached to a Pixhawk is moved rapidly ). The key thing is that the digital servo causes the voltage on the rail to rise above the critical 5.7V level. Above that level the Pixhawk power management will cut power to the FMU and the Pixhawk will reboot. If that happens when flying you will lose your aircraft.

It is up to the user to provide a clean source of power for the cases when it is powered off the servo rail. Servos by themselves are not quiet enough.</li>
	<li>Do not connect a BEC power source to the RC IN port (black ground, red power and white signal wires from the receiver's PPM ouput are connected to these RC pins)</li>
	<li>Adding an external Zener is a recommendation specifically for systems that are using 5V servos and have the servo rail configured for back up power. Connect the recommended Zener diode with its polarity as indicated on the diagram. Use as short wires as possible or even better, use a standard 3 position JR servo connector with the diode legs directly inserted (and soldered) in the servo female pins. To complement the diode, it is also useful to add a capacitorin parallel to the diode. The capacitor will smooth out eventual voltage ripples. As advised for the diode, the capacitor should be connected with as short wires as possible. Do not oversize the capacitor.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Voltage ratings</h1>

Pixhawk can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied. The three rails are: Power module input, servo rail input, USB input.

<strong>Normal Operation Maximum Ratings</strong>
Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system.
Power module input (4.1V to 5.7V) [refers to the voltage coming into Pixhawk from the power module]
Servo rail input (4.1V to 5.7V)
USB power input (4.1V to 5.7V)

<strong>Absolute Maximum Ratings</strong>
Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.
Power module input (0V to 20V) [refers to the voltage coming into Pixhawk from the power module]
Servo rail input (0V to 20V)
USB power input (0V to 6V)
