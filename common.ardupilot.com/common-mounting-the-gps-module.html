This page covers the mounting of GPS without an on-board compass. See <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-installing-3dr-ublox-gps-compass-module/">this page</a> for the GPS+compass module.


<h1>Tips on mounting the GPS module</h1>

<ul>
	<li>For modules without an on-board compass, the orientation does not matter as long as the square antenna side is facing up</li>
	<li>The GPS should have a clear view of the sky and not be under spinning propelllers</li>
	<li>It should be mounted as far away as possible from radio transmission equipment (telemetry, video transmitters), motors, and ESCs.</li>
</ul>


Below are example mounting positions for a 3DR quad and Flamewheel
