This article shows how to check that the main main sensors (including position and GPS) are working properly.

<h1>Checking the main sensors</h1>
With <em>Mission Planner</em> connected, move the flight controller board and you should see the artificial horizon move accordingly.

[note]Remember how artificial horizons work: when the aircraft tilts to the right, the horizon tilts to the left (tilt your head and you'll see what I mean). This is normal![/note]

In the screenshot below, the vehicle is tilted a bit to the right.

The map will also show your current position using the GPS sensor if you have the GPS module connected, are outside and have GPS lock.


<h1>Display Sensor Data on Graph</h1>

You can see the output from all the various sensors by clicking on the <strong>Tuning</strong> checkbox on the bottom right of the display <span style="background-color: #ff6600;color: #ffffff"><strong>  1  </strong></span> This will bring up the graphical sensor display.

If you click on the legend at the top of it <span style="background-color: #ff6600;color: #ffffff"><strong>  2  </strong></span> , it will bring up a window <strong>"Graph This"</strong> that allows you to choose which sensors and data outputs to display.
