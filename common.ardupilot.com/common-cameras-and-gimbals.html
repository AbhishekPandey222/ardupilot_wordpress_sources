Copter, Plane and Rover support up to 3-axis gimbals, including advance features like automated aiming of the camera at a Region of Interest (ROI), and automatic triggering of a camera shutter.  This article explains how to configure gimbals and shutter triggering based on your hardware setup.

<h1>Gimbals and gimbal controllers</h1>

UAVs use gimbals to provide an independently controlled and stable platform for photography. ArduPilot supports both brushless direct drive gimbals (Tarot, SToRM32) that have a separate controller (providing self-stabilisation), and the increasingly-less-common servo-driven gimbals where both control and gimbal stabilisation are provided by ArduPilot.

<h1>Camera shutter triggering</h1>

ArduPilot allows you to <a href="common-camera-shutter-with-servo" title="common-Camera Shutter Configuration in Mission Planner">configure the camera shutter output port</a> (servo, relay). In <a href="common-camera-control-and-auto-missions-in-mission-planner" title="common-Camera Control and Auto Missions in Mission Planner">camera mission planning</a> you can specify when the camera shutter should trigger, or a distance that the vehicle should travel between shots. 

Camera manufacturers use their own mechanisms for remote control of the camera (including its shutter). The topics explain how to configure the camera shutter, and list a number of different approaches for converting the output signal into the form expected by your particular camera:
