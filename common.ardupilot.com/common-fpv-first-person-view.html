<em>First Person View</em> provides you with a true pilot's eye view while flying by placing a video camera and transmitter on your vehicle paired with a receiver and either an LCD or goggles on the ground.  An optional OSD (On Screen Display) helps maintain orientation by providing aircraft instrument overlay on your FPV monitor.

<h1>Recommended parts</h1>

The <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-fpv-osd-kit" target="_blank">3DR Video/OSD Kit</a> provides most of what you need to set-up an FPV system on your ArduCopter/ArduPlane equipped vehicle:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/super-had-ccd-camera-1-3-sony-520tv-lines" target="_blank"><em>Sony CCD camera</em></a></li>
	<li><em><a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/apm-minimosd-rev-1-1" target="_blank">MinimOSD</a> for On Screen Display of aircraft data</em></li>
	<li><em>5.8Ghz 200mw video transmitter/receiver pair</em></li>
	<li><em>Two 900mAh LiPo batteries (one for the air, one for the ground) to power the transmitter, receiver and camera</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

In addition you will need a monitor like the <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/fpv-monitor-1" target="_blank">Black Pearl</a> or goggles.


<strong>Goggle options:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.fatshark.com/default.html" target="_blank">Fat Shark</a> has a wide range of goggles including the "Attitude" and "Dominator" that have been proven to work.  Note that some models come with a built in transmitter &amp; receiver that would replace the 3DR video kits 5.8 Ghz transmitter/receiver pair mentioned above.</li>
	<li>Low cost 320x240 resolution goggles (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG-4JNpE2fc" target="_blank">example video</a>) are not recommended because the higher resolution 640x480 (<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywqacXyjcNw" target="_blank">example video</a>) or SVGA goggles provide a much better flying experience.</li>
</ul>


In addition you may wish to set-up a separate <a href="wiki/common-cameras-and-gimbals/">camera gimbal </a>(perhaps with Go-Pro attached) to record the flight in HD.



<h1>Connection diagram</h1>

Here is a wiring diagram <a href="http://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/TBS_Discovery_graphic" target="_blank">created by IVC</a> for a TBS Discovery Quadcopter that includes an APM2 and MinimOSD:

FPV equipment on the vehicle should be placed as far away as possible from GPS and RC receiver to reduce the chance of interference.

<h1>Safety Warnings Relating Specifically to FPV Flight</h1>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="color: #ff0000">Because of the limited field-of-view of the FPV camera you may not be able to easily see obstacles near the vehicle which may be why the <span style="color: #ff0000"><a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/" target="_blank">Academy of Model Aeronautics</a> requires that there be a second person acting as spotter for all FPV flights.</span>
</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000">Be ready for loss of FPV video caused by flying beyond your FPV systems limits or interference from structures between you and the vehicle.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000">Know and recognise the FPV signal loss warning signs and be ready to shed the FPV equipment and retake manual control at all times.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000">FPV equipment can interfere with the vehicle's radio or GPS if placed too close</span></li>
</ul>
