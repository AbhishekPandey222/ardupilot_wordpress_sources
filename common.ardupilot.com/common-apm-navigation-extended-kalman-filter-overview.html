Copter and Plane can use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to estimate vehicle position, velocity and angular orientation based on rate gyroscopes, accelerometer, magnetometer, GPS, airspeed and barometric pressure measurements. 

The advantage of the EKF over the simpler complementary filter algorithms, is that by fusing all available measurements it is better able to reject measurements with significant errors. This makes the vehicle less susceptible to faults that affect a single sensor.  EKF also enables measurements from optional sensors such as optical flow and laser range finders to be used to assist navigation.

A more detailed overview of EKF benefits, theory and <em>tuning parameters</em> is available on the developer wiki topic <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/extended-kalman-filter/">Extended Kalman Filter Navigation Overview and Tuning</a>.
