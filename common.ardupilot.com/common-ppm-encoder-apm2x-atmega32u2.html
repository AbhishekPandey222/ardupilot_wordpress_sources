[archived date=20160226]The APM2.x is end of life and is not generally available for purchase. This article is made available for existing users.[/archived]

This article describes the PPM Encoder that is embedded in APM2.5/6 boards. It is provided for use in the (very unlikely) event that the encoder needs to be reprogrammed.

<h1>How to flash the Atmega32U2 (PPM encoder) through USB</h1> 

If you every find yourself in a situation where your PPM encoder has become corrupted for some reason, or you want to upload a new version, you can. The PPM encoder (ATMega32-U2) has an special bootloader that allows you to flash it without needing a special SPI programmer. The 32U2 firmware controls the USB connection to the 2560 and is also used to convert radio PCM signals to a PPM signal for the 2560.  APM 2.5 modules shipped before March 4th 2013  have an older version of the firmware. Here is a discussion on the newer <a href="http://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/new-arduppm-firmware-version-2-3-16-in-the-downloads-section" target="_blank">firmware</a>.



<h1>What you need</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Windows XP/Vista/7</li>
	<li>USB cable</li>
	<li>Download and install Flip, click <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/FLIP.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong>.</a></li>
	<li>The firmware (HEX file) you want to load can be <a href="http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?did=26" target="_blank"><strong>downloaded here</strong></a>.</li>
	<li><em id="__mceDel">(The source code, while not necessary if using the compiled code, <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/ArduPPM/Libraries/PPM_Encoder.h" target="_blank"><strong>can be found here</strong></a>.)</em></li>
</ul>



<h1>Putting the Atmega32U2 into programming (DFU) mode</h1>



<h4>For the APM 2.5 board</h4>
<ul>
	<li>First, unscrew the top of your APM 2.5 case, so you can get to the pins.</li>
	<li>After installing flip, connect your APM 2.5 to your computer with your USB cable.</li>
	<li>When turned on, insert a jumper cap into the JP2 port to short it, as indicated in the picture below.
<ul>
	<li>This is the same small jumper that came with your APM 2.5 board.</li>
	<li>If you're currently using it on the JP1 pins, temporarily move it to JP2. When you're done with the procedures on this page, you can move it back to JP1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Use a pair of needle-nosed pliers or a little piece of wire to short circuit the GND and RST pins of the Atmega32U2 in order to reset it.</li>
	<li>You can find those pins broken out in the chip's ICSP header on the edge of the board:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>After reseting you will hear the USB disconnect/connect sound in your Windows computer.</li>
	<li>Your board should be in DFU mode now and ready to be programmed.</li>
</ul>



<h4>For the APM 2 board</h4>
<ul>
	<li>After installing flip, connect your APM 2 to your computer with your USB cable.</li>
	<li>When turned on, insert a jumper cap into the JP2 port to short it, as indicated in the picture below.
<ul>
	<li>This is the same small jumper that came with your APM 2 board.</li>

<h1>Using FLIP to upload the firmware</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Open Flip by double clicking the flip icon:
<img alt="" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/flip_icon.jpg" /></li>
	<li>When opened you will see a window like this:
<img alt="" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/flip_main.jpg" /></li>
	<li>Press on the icon indicated with a red arrow or just go to the menu “Device-&gt;Select” or just press Ctrl+S.</li>
	<li>Then select Atmega32U2 and click OK. If this doesn't work, see 3a below. <img alt="" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/flip_step3.jpg" /></li>
	<li><i>4a) If you get an alert box that says "AtLibUsbDfu.dll not found", you'll need to load an updated driver for your board in DFU mode. </i>
<ul>
	<li><i>Go to the Windows Device Manager (in the Control Panel/Hardware and Sound) and you should see the Atmega chip highlighted with an exclamation point, signifying an error. </i></li>
	<li><i>Right-click on it, and choose "Update Driver Software". </i></li>
	<li><i>Then choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and navigate to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Flip 3.4.7\usb" folder (if you're using a different version of Flip, the folder name will reflect that version). </i></li>
	<li><i>Then press Next and it should install the correct driver. Restart FLIP and do steps 1-3 again; they should work this time.</i> 4)</li>
	<li>Click on the icon indicated with an arrow or just go the menu “Settings-&gt;Communications-&gt;USB” or just press Ctrl+U and click “Open”.</li>
</ul>

	<li><em>Before you upload new firmware you can view the current firmware in the buffer. Some PPM firmware versions will have the version embedded in the code.  Click [Device] [Read] to download the current memory into the buffer and then [Buffer] [Edit] to view. (See Flip manual for details.)  The version may be near the end of the code before all the FF entries.  Here is a sample of the end of the code segment for one version of the PPM firmware.</em>
