This section of Mission Planner, invoked by the Menu item Initial Setup at the top of Mission Planner, has several subsections. The subsection are where you set up and configure you auto pilot to prepare it for your particular vehicle. Typically these sections are "must do" actions that are required.

What you see when you enter this section depends on whether or not you are connected. Each menu item will bring up a new screen, each is discussed below with links to more detail.
<h3>Install Firmware</h3>
You will see this menu item If the auto pilot is Not connected. If you have a new auto pilot or if you want to update the control software that resides in you autopilot, you must install (upload) the <a href="/wiki/common-glossary/">firmware</a> into it. Before you jump to the details for your auto pilot some basic information is important

Add words about where is the firmware, must have internet connection, how do you select the right version, beta version, what are the funny numbers you see in previous revisions - click one and you will see all the versions under each vehicle icon. .

Here are the details for each auto pilot:
