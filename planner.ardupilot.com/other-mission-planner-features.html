Other features that aren't specific to the modes already described in the menu:
<ul>
	<li>The Mission Planner Console:  When you first open Mission Planner you will see a small window with a black background with a lot of text scrolling by.  When Mission Planner finally opens, the window may disappear. That window is called the console. You can keep it alive by checking a box at the bottom of the Mission Planner help screen.</li>

	<li>Shortcut Keys:
<ul>
	<li>F12 - disconnect or connect from/to USB or Telemetry</li>
	<li>F5 - Refresh parameters</li>
	<li>F2 - change to Flight Data tab</li>
	<li>F3 - change to Flight Planner tab</li>
	<li>F4 - change to Configuration tab</li>
	<li>F5 - Refresh parameter list</li>
<li>CTL-G Nmea Output</li>
<li>CTL-W Wizard config interface</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li>You can display video from your aircraft on the Mission Planner's HUD if you are digitizing it with the same laptop (with a video capture card or USB device). Just select the device in the Configuration/Planner screen, chose video format and press "Start" to begin recording. If you select the HUD checkbox, the video display will replace the artificial horizon in the HUD.</li>

	<li>You can also record the video that you're displaying to an AVI file. Just right-click in the HUD and choose from the menu that will pop up.</li>

	<li>You can send NMEA (GPS) output to the serial port. Press control-g and you will get a box asking for a comport and baud rate to output standard nmea data at 2 hz, to any serial port. One application would be to use com2com to emulate a serial port to use with third party applications.</li>

	<li>You can have the Mission Planner load non-standard firmware (any .hex files that you've made or got elsewhere) to APM by pressing Control-C on the firmware loading screen.</li>

	<li>Mission Planner can give you audio speech alerts for events that you choose, such as hitting waypoints or low battery. Just go to <strong>Configuration | Planner | Speech | Enable Speech</strong></li>

	<li>Mission Planner source code can be downloaded and compiled (built) by those with programming skills in C# and who are familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio - see <a title="Building Mission Planner with Visual Studio" href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/buildin-mission-planner/">Building Mission Planner with Visual Studio</a> (Dev Wiki).</li>

	<li>Mission Planner can be scripted  - see <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-other-mission-planner-features/using-python-scripts-in-mission-planner/">Using Python Scripts in Mission Planner</a> (planner wiki)</li>
