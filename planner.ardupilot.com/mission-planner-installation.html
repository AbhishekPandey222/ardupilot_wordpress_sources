</ul>
<strong>Updates:</strong> If you are connected to the internet, Mission Planner checks for updates each day. You can accept the update or not. Updates are important because Mission Planner is always being modified  for enhancements, to fix bugs and to support the various auto pilots, Planes, Copters, and Rovers.  Updates will include new defaults for parameters for the various vehicles.  If you update the firmware in your auto pilot you would be wise to update Mission Planner to the latest version. During the update you will see various screens and scrolling data.  These screens are not important to the normal user - just wait for Mission Planner to re-start.
