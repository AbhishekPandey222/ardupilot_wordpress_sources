To connect your Auto Pilot to Mission Planner, you must select the proper communication settings then click the connect icon in the upper right portion of the Mission Planner window. Here are the details.

<h3>Communication Settings</h3>
To establish the connection you must first select which method you will be using (USB, Telemetry Radio, Other methods) and the data rate to be used.  These options available are in the drop down boxes in the upper right portion of the screen.  Before the selections are available the drivers for the different hardware must be present.  Windows will automatically assign your autopilot a COM port number, and that will show in the drop-down menu as shown below (it doesn't matter what number is assigned, and it probably won't be the 13 shown). The data rates are set to defaults when the drivers are installed.  Typically the USB connection data rate is 11520 and the 3DR radio connection rate is 57600.  The connection will not be made unless the correct method and data rates are selected.
