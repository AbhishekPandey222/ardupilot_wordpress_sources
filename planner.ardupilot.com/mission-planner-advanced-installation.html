<h3>Installing Mission Planner In a Different Location</h3>

Some times you may want to keep  or install the current or different version of Mission Planner in a folder different from the normal location used by the <a title="Normal MSI method to install Mission Planner" href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/initial-setup/common-install-mission-planner/">MSI installation</a>. You can do this by downloading the "zip" version which contains all the files necessary and placing the files into a folder of your choice. In general, using older versions is discouraged, because the latest version should work with most platforms and will have fewer bugs. However, an example might be that you are using an older APM with an older version of firmware that is working well for you, and, you do not want to update the firmware and.. you are used to using the matching version of Mission Planner which you also do not want to upgrade.  Another example is when you have more than one platform (for instance a plane and a quad copter or two planes) and you want to keep a different version of the Mission Planner for each on your ground station.  This keeps the configuration files, the log files and saved parameter files separate - making life much easier.

<strong>Warning: Use older versions of Mission Planner at your own risk.  Do not attempt to upgrade firmware with older versions. Each new platform firmware update usually requires the latest Mission Planner version.</strong>

Note: you will need a version of WinZip to install in a different location. Search for "Winzip free" for possible ad supported versions.
<h3>Download the most recent Mission Planner ZIP Files</h3>



You can find all the different version of Mission Planner zip (and MSI) files <strong><a title="Previous Mission Planner revisions" href="http://firmware.diydrones.com/Tools/MissionPlanner/" target="_blank">here</a>.  </strong>Alternatively, for just the current version, go to the <strong><a href="http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?category=29" target="_blank">Mission Planner Download page</a></strong> and click on "MissionPlanner - ZIP - Permanent link to latest".

Download and save the zip file to your computer.
<h3>Install (Un-zip) the files to the desired folder</h3>



Here is how you "install" a version into a different folder:
<ul>
	<li>Unzip the downloaded zip files into the folder where you want them installed. (see your winzip manual)
We suggest un-zipping to Program Files folder where the normal installation is, but with a different folder name I.E. a folder name like APM Planner-xxx where xxx is the version number.</li>
	<li>After you do the un-zip, you should have all the files necessary to run that version of MP in the new folder.
<ul>
	<li>You can run this version by double clicking on the ArdupilotMegaPlanner10.exe file in the folder's root.</li>
	<li>Be sure to answer "no" to the upgrade notice if you want to stay with the version you are using in that folder.</li>
	<li>To create a desktop icon for that version do this:
<ul>
	<li>Find the fileArdupilotMegaPlanner10.exe in the folder's root.</li>
	<li>Right click and hold the file name and drag it to your desktop</li>
	<li>Select the 'Create a shortcut here" option when you release the mouse button.</li>
	<li>Right click on the new icon and select Rename.</li>
	<li>Change the name to include the version number or some text to identify the icon to start this version of MP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
