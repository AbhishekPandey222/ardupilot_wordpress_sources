<h3>Usage</h3>
Normal Flying-wing aircraft uses two control surfaces as Elevons to control pitch and roll. In some cases, rudders are added to the winglets to control yaw. Differential spoiler takes advantage of splitting elevons to 4 independent control surfaces: normal elevon functions are reserved for pitch and roll control, but yaw control is done by using two surfaces on one side of the wing to create drag force thus controlling yaw motion. If calibrated correctly, it will ensure pilot has smooth yaw control during take-off and landing as well as compensation during turning (similar to differential aileron).

<h3>Preparation</h3>
To use differential spoiler function, the airframe is required to use have 4 control surfaces (2 on each wing) and use elevon configuration. Setup one surface on each side using output channel 1 (roll) and channel 2 (pitch) as elevons:

<strong>If you have not done so, please follow the tutorial to setup elevon properly:</strong> <a href="http://plane.ardupilot.com/wiki/arduplane-setup/connecting-your-rc-gear/">(Here!)</a>


<h3>Setup</h3>
Once you have setup two elevon channels successfully, connect the additional 2 surfaces to auxiliary channles (5 to 11 on APM2.X) and set corresponding <strong>RC_FUNCTION</strong>:


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Function Name</strong></td>
<td><strong>Function Number</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Differential Spoiler 1</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>This should be set to the control surface on the same side of elevon connected to output channel 1 (roll channel)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Differential Spoiler 2</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>This should be set to the control surface on the same side of elevon connected to output channel 2 (pitch channel)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


By now, you should have normal elevon function in MANUAL mode. Now switch to FBW mode and use RC controller to test roll, pitch and yaw. Adjust corresponding <strong>RC_REV</strong> until the behavior is correct.

<strong>Note:</strong> if you have servo direction reversed on either side of the wing, it is most likely that the servo orientations are different or rotation is reversed through programming on some digital servos
