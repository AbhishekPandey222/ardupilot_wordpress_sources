In RTL mode the plane will return to launch point (the point where the plane first got a GPS lock) and loiter there until manual control is regained (or it runs out of fuel!). As with <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> mode you can also "nudge" the aircraft manually in this mode using stick mixing. The target altitude for RTL mode is set using the <a href="arduplane-parameters/#RTL_altitude_PlaneALT_HOLD_RTL">ALT_HOLD_RTL</a> parameter in centimeters.

Alternatively, you may <a title="Rally Point Documentation" href="common-rally-points">configure the plane to return to a Rally Point</a>, rather than the launch point.


[warning]"Home" position is always supposed to be your Plane's actual GPS takeoff location:


<ol>
	<li>It is very important to acquire GPS lock before arming in order for RTL, Loiter, Auto or any GPS dependent mode to work properly.</li>
	<li>For Plane the home position is the postion of the Plane when you first get GPS lock whether it was armed or not.
          <ul>
	  <li>This means if you execute an RTL in Plane, it will return to the location where it was when it first acquired GPS lock.</li>
	  <li>For Plane: Plug in the battery and let it acquire GPS lock where you want it to return to: (Not the Pits).</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
</ol>
