The first 4 output channels in Plane have specific meanings - typically Aileron, Elevator, Throttle and Rudder. Beyond that you may map the remaining output channels to any of a large number of output functions. On a board like the Pixhawk which has 14 output channels that means you have 10 channels that you can freely assign to any function.

This page describes how to configure these output channels and what each of the available functions is.
<h2>The RCn_FUNCTION parameters</h2>
In the advanced parameter view of your GCS you will find that each RC output channel beyond channel 4 has a RCn_FUNCTION parameter. For example, RC5_FUNCTION controls the output function of channel 5, RC6_FUNCTION controls the output function of channel 6 and so on.

The values you can set these parameters to are shared with copters and rovers, and not all of them have been implemented on fixed wing aircraft. The ones that are implemented on fixed wing are listed below:
<ul>
	<li>Disabled=0</li>
	<li>RCPassThru=1</li>
	<li>Flap=2</li>
	<li>Flap_auto=3</li>
	<li>Aileron=4</li>
	<li>mount_pan=6</li>
	<li>mount_tilt=7</li>
	<li>mount_roll=8</li>
	<li>camera_trigger=10</li>
	<li>mount2_pan=12</li>
	<li>mount2_tilt=13</li>
	<li>mount2_roll=14</li>
	<li>DifferentialSpoiler1=16</li>
	<li>DifferentialSpoiler2=17</li>
	<li>AileronWithInput=18</li>
	<li>Elevator=19</li>
	<li>ElevatorWithInput=20</li>
	<li>Rudder=21</li>
	<li>Flaperon1=24</li>
	<li>Flaperon2=25</li>
	<li>GroundSteering=26</li>
</ul>
The default value for all channels is 0, meaning disabled. That means the channel will output the trim value for that channel (for example, if RC5_FUNCTION is 0 then channel 5 will output RC5_TRIM) unless it is overridden by a mission command.

All of these functions may be used on multiple channels. So if you want 3 more elevator channels for some reason you can set RCn_FUNCTION to 19 on 3 of your output channels. The normal elevator (channel 2) will still work, but you will also have 3 extra elevons, each of which you can trim and set the range of separately.
<h2>Disabled</h2>
For normal operation, the Disabled output function sets the output value of the channel to the trim value. The exception to this is when a MAVLink override of the channel or a mission servo set is used. So in some ways "disabled" could be called "mission-controlled".

When you fly an auto mission you can ask for a servo to be set to a value as part of that mission. In that case you should set the RCn_FUNCTION for that channel to Disabled, so that the value doesn't get changed by another output function immediately after the mission sets the value.
<h2>RCPassThru</h2>
Setting a channel to RCPassThru means it will output the value that is coming into the board from the corresponding input channel. For example, if RC5_FUNCTION is 1 (meaning RCPassThru) then channel 5 output will always be equal to channel 5 input.
<h2>Flap</h2>
When a channel is set as a flap it's value comes from the flap input channel (controlled by the FLAP_IN_CHANNEL parameter). The reason you may want to use this instead of a RCPassThru is that you can setup multiple flap channels with different trims and ranges, and you may want to take advantage of the FLAP_SLEWRATE to limit the speed of flap movement.
<h2>Flap_auto</h2>
The flap auto output function behaves like the Flap output, except it can also accept automatic flap output from the TKOFF_FLAP_PCNT and LAND_FLAP_PERCNT parameters, as well as the FLAP_1_SPEED, FLAP_1_PERCNT, FLAP_2_SPEED and FLAP_2_PERCNT parameters.

If you have both a FLAP_IN_CHANNEL set and a Flap_auto output function set then the amount of flap applied is the higher of the two.
<h2>Aileron</h2>
The aileron output function adds additional aileron outputs, with separate per-channel trim and range. This is useful when you want to trim each aileron separately, or if your main aileron is setup as an elevon mixer (using the ELEVON_OUTPUT option), and you also want some normal ailerons.
<h2>AileronWithInput</h2>
The AileronWithInput function is used where you have setup your transmitter to input the aileron signal you want on this channel on the corresponding input channel for this output. For example, if you set RC6_FUNCTION=18 and have setup your transmitter to send the right aileron signal for manual mode to channel 6 then you can use AileronWithInput. The main difference is in manual mode. In manual with AileronWithInput the output comes directly from the corresponding input channel. With the Aileron output function the output in manual mode is based on the main aileron input channel (usually channel 1) but trimmed and scaled according to the RC6 trim values.
<h2>Mount_pan, Mount_tilt and Mount_roll</h2>
These control the output channels for controlling a servo gimbal. Please see the <a href="/wiki/common-camera-gimbal/">camera gimbal configuration documentation</a> for details.

The Mount2_pan, Mount2_tilt and Mount2_roll options are the same, but control a second camera gimbal
<h2>Camera_trigger</h2>
The Camera_trigger output function is used to trigger a camera with a servo. See the <a href="/wiki/common-camera-gimbal">camera gimbal documentation</a> for details.
<h2>Elevator</h2>
The elevator output function adds additional elevator outputs, with separate per-channel trim and range. This is useful when you want to trim each elevator separately, or if your main elevator is setup as an elevon mixer (using the ELEVON_OUTPUT option), and you also want some normal elevator.
<h2>ElevatorWithInput</h2>
The ElevatorWithInput function is used where you have setup your transmitter to input the elevator signal you want on this channel on the corresponding input channel for this output. For example, if you set RC6_FUNCTION=20 and have setup your transmitter to send the right elevator signal for manual mode to channel 6 then you can use ElevatorWithInput. The main difference is in manual mode. In manual with ElevatorWithInput the output comes directly from the corresponding input channel. With the Elevator output function the output in manual mode is based on the main elevator input channel (usually channel 2) but trimmed and scaled according to the RC6 trim values.
<h2>Rudder</h2>
The rudder output function adds additional rudder outputs, with separate per-channel trim and range. Separate rudder channels is particularly useful for nose wheel steering where the nose wheel may need to be reversed as compared to the normal rudder channel or for multi-wheel planes.
<h2>GroundSteering</h2>
The GroundSteering output function acts much like the rudder output function except that it only acts when the aircraft is below GROUND_STEER_ALT altitude. At altitudes above GROUND_STEER_ALT the output will be the trim value for the channel.
<h2>Flaperon1 and Flaperon2</h2>
Using the flaperon1 and flaperon2 output functions you can setup flaperons, which are ailerons that double as flaps. They are very useful for aircraft which have ailerons but no flaps.

To use the flaperon output functions you need to also set the FLAPERON_OUTPUT option to the right value (from 1 to 4) for your servo setup. See the <a href="/wiki/arduplane-setup/first-time-apm-setup/reversing-servos-and-setting-normalelevon-mode">Elevon setup page</a> for a more detailed description of how this parameter works (that page is for elevons, but flaperons work in the same manner).

Note that flaperons act like Flap_auto described above for the flap component of the output.
