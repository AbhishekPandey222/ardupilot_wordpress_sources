<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaperon">Flaperons</a> use your 2 ailerons (using one channel each) as both flaps and ailerons. This article shows how to set up Flaperons in Plane.<!-- more -->
[note]This page was tested on Plane 3.3, but should be relevant to older versions. It was originally created from <a href="http://marc.merlins.org/perso/rc/post_2015-08-04_Using-Flaperons-With-Ardupilot.html">this blog post</a>.[/note]



<h1>Input/Output Channels</h1>

A brief discussion on input and output channels may help.  The channels from the transmitter in your hand, to the receiver on the vehicle, and then into the autopilot on the vehicle are your INPUT channels.  The channels from the autopilot to your servo's etc are the OUTPUT channels. The input and output channels may not directly map to one another.

Flaperons are the classic example of a setup where input and output channels do not map directly.  The autopilot will use the input from the aileron (INPUT channel 1) AND the input from the flap channel (INPUT channel 5 - in the example below) and "mix" them to calculate how the flaperons on the plane should move. The result is sent out to each flap OUTPUT channel (channels 5 and 6 in the example below).


<h1>Flaperon setup</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Do not do any aileron mixing on your transmitter. </li>
<li>INPUTS:
  <ul>
	<li>Leave the standard aileron input on channel 1.</li>
	<li>You need to add an input channel on your transmitter to control the flaps. You can configure any unused input channel for this however we are going to use RC5.  Configure your transmitter to use Channel 5 for flaps (either a switch or a rotary button) and set <a href="arduplane-parameters/#flap_input_channel_arduplaneflap_in_channel">FLAP_IN_CHANNEL</a> to 5.</li>
	<li>Move your ailerons to 2 spare output channels on the autopilot that you aren't using.  In this example we are using channels 5 and 6.</li>

  </ul>
</li>
<li>OUTPUTS:
  <ul>
	<li>Set <a href="arduplane-parameters/#servo_out_function_rc5_function">RC5_FUNCTION</a> and <a href="arduplane-parameters/#servo_out_function_rc6_function">RC6_FUNCTION</a> to 24 and 25 (Flaperon 1 and flaperon 2 respectively - which channel is which does not matter).</li>
	<li>Check that <a href="arduplane-parameters/#rc_min_pwm_rc5_min">RC5_MIN</a>, <a href="arduplane-parameters/#rc_max_pwm_rc5_max">RC5_MAX</a>, <a href="arduplane-parameters/#rc_trim_pwm_rc5_trim">RC5_TRIM</a> has the correct range set if you haven't used them previously.  If your unsure usually 1000, 2000, 1500 will work fine.  Do the same for the RC6 equivalents.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
	<li>Set <a href="arduplane-parameters/#flaperon_output_arduplaneflaperon_output">FLAPERON_OUTPUT</a> to 1 initially.</li>
	<li>Switch to FBWA or CRUISE.  Roll your plane back and forth and make sure the ailerons move in the correct direction (aileron goes down on the wing that you roll down). If they don't, try setting <code>FLAPERON_OUTPUT</code> to 4.</li>
	<li>Once this works, try your flaps control on your transmitter and make sure flaps go down and not up. If they go the wrong way, change <code>RC1_REV</code> from 1 to -1 (or the other way around) and test again.  Once working go back and check <code>FLAPERON_OUTPUT</code> in the step above as it may also need to change again.</li>
	<li>Confirm that when in FBWA and your roll the plane the ailerons move in the correct direction, and that your flaps go down.</li>
	<li>Now try the ailerons stick on your transmitter. If they go the wrong way, reverse channel 1 on the transmitter ONLY.  Test again.  If you put your stick left, the left aileron should go up.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Tuning</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Go to failsafe setup in <em>APM Planner 2</em> or <em>Mission Planner</em>, and make sure the max/min values match <code>RC5_MIN</code>/<code>RC5_MAX</code> (or adjust them) so that your flaps move all the way (<code>RC1_TRIM</code> should also be set to 1500).</li>
	<li>Setting the <a href="arduplane-parameters/#flap_slew_rate_arduplaneflap_slewrate">FLAP_SLEWRATE</a> to 100 allows moving flaps from 0 to 100% in one second.  Lower this to make your flaps move more slowly.</li>
	<li>Adjust <code>FLAP_x_PERCNT|SPEED</code> as desired for auto modes - see <a href="arduplane-setup/first-time-apm-setup/automatic-flaps">Automatic Flaps.</a> Note you can ignore the comment on that page saying "parameter for the channel function for the channel you are using for flaps to a value of 3". <code>FLAP_IN_CHANNEL</code> is already set for this.</li>
	<li>Have a look at <a href="arduplane-parameters/#takeoff_flap_percentage_arduplanetkoff_flap_pcnt">TKOFF_FLAP_PCNT</a> and LAND_FLAP_PERCNT if they are relevant to you.</li>
	<li>When you are flying in manual mode, it can be helpful to setup an elevator down mix on your TX when you set flaps i.e. the more flaps you send, the more elevator down you should send to correct pitch up from flaps. If possible set up the mix value on a rotary switch so that you can control the elevator down correction during a test flight.  If you set too much elevator down as a fixed value in your mix, you'll be stuck not being able to use flaps for landing if you put too much elevator down.</li>
</ul>
[tip]Don't fly until you've rechecked that FBWA/CRUISE moves the ailerons in the right direction and that ailerons also go in the right direction in manual mode.[/tip]


<h1>Crow flaperons</h1>
If you need Crow flaps (i.e if your ailerons must go up, not down), you can use these instructions and reverse <code>RC1_REV</code> so that when you send flaps input, ailerons go up instead of down. Then you should be able to set your flaps channels as <a href="channel-output-functions/#flap">FLAP</a> or <a href="channel-output-functions/#flap_auto">FLAP_AUTO</a>.

See <a href="fixed-wing-faq/#how_would_i_setup_crow_flaps">How would I setup crow flaps?</a> (Fixed Wing FAQ) for more information.


<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Manual flaps input is mixed into auto modes. That means if you're landing in manual mode with flaps set to full on your transmitter, and you flip the mode to RTL or some other mode to abort the landing and go back to an auto mode, flaps will stay full. You need to retract them on your transimitter.</li>
	<li><code>RCx_MIN</code> and <code>RCx_MAX</code> for Flaperon output channels limit deflection of Flaperons and you can use the TRIM value to move the neutral position in case you want more down travel than up travel.</li>
	<li><code>RC1_TRIM</code> acts as normal aileron trim.  <code>RC1_MIN</code> and <code>RC1_MAX</code> should match the transmitter setting</li>
</ul>
