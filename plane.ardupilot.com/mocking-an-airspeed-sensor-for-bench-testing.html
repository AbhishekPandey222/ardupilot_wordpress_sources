This article explains how you can use a potentiometer with Pixhawk in order to simulate the input from an Airspeed Sensor. This is very useful for ground testing.

<h3>Overview</h3>

If your aerodynamic surfaces (i.e. auto flaps, ailerons, elevators, elevons, etc.) are geared or actuated with airspeed, it may be helpful to ground test them on your aircraft by sending Pixhawk a specific airspeed. 

On Pixhawk you can plug a potentiometer into ADC 6.6v (pin 15) or ADC 3.3v (pin 11). Assuming you have an <a title="I2C airspeed sensor" href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/pixhawk-airspeed-sensor-kit">I2C airspeed sensor</a> plugged in to the <a title="I2C Splitter" href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/pixhawk-i2c-splitter">I2C splitter</a> and set to Pin 65, you can also plug in a simple potentiometer into the "<a title="ADC 6.6v" href="common-pixhawk-overview/#pixhawk_analog_input_pins">ADC 6.6v</a>" Pin 15 as shown below.

<h3>Required parts</h3>
You will need this <a title="DF-13 Cable" href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/df13-3-position-connector-19-cm">DF-13 cable</a>, and a simple <a title="potentiometer" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9939">potentiometer like this</a> or <a title="this" href="http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__39510__Potentiameter_Round_Pot_Turnigy_9XR_Transmitter_3set_.htmlhttp://">this</a>. Either a B10K and B5K potentiometer can be used to set speed from 0 to as much as 90 m/s.

<h3>Pixhawk Configuration and Settings</h3>
Once the DF 13 cable is connected to the potentiometer, plug it into the <a title="ADC 6.6v" href="common-pixhawk-overview/#pixhawk_analog_input_pins">ADC 6.6v port</a>. Open your Ground Control Station (GCS) of choice, and change the “<strong>ARSPD_PIN</strong>” parameter to Pin "<strong>15"</strong> as shown below.

If your Pixhawk was powered on with the I2C Airspeed sensor and Pin 65 selected, your speed will probably display something &gt;12 m/s. If you need to set the speed to something specific between 0 and 12 m/s, just power down and power up the Pixhawk with Pin 15 set before you power down. Airspeed will reset to 1-3 m/s after the restart and initialization is complete. Adjust the pot to set your desired speed. 

[note]<em>Remember to re-enable the airspeed sensor! </em> Set the “ARSPD_PIN” pin to 65, and cycle the Pixhawk power to ensure the I2C airspeed properly initializes. Check you get the normal 1-3 m/s noise on the airspeed display.[/note]
