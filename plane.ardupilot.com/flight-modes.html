<h1>Overview</h1>

Plane has a wide range of built in flight modes. Plane can act as a simple flight stabilization system, a sophisticated autopilot, a training system or a flight safety system depending on what flight mode and options you choose. 

Flight modes are controlled through a <a href="common-rc-transmitter-flight-mode-configuration">radio transmitter switch</a>, via mission commands, or using commands from a ground station (GCS) or companion computer.
