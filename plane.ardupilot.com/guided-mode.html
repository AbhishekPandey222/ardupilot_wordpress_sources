The GUIDED mode is used when you want the aircraft to fly to a specific point on the map without setting up a mission. Most ground control stations support a "click to fly to" feature where you can click a point on the map and the aircraft will fly to that location when loiter.

The other major use for GUIDED mode is in <a href="geofencing">geo-fencing</a>. When the geo-fence is breached the aircraft will enter GUIDED mode, and head to the predefined geo-fence return point, where it will loiter until the operator takes over.
