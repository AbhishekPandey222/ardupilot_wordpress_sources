Plane has a limited failsafe function which is designed to do three things:
<ol>
	<li>Detect complete loss of RC signal (if the RC receiver is able to generate a predictable signal-loss behavior) and initiate a defined auto-mode response, such as returning to home. Some RC equipment can do this, and some can't (see below for details on how to use it if yours supports this function).</li>
	<li>Detect loss of telemetry for more than 20 sec and switch to return to launch (RTL) mode (GCS Failsafe).</li>
	<li>Detect loss of GPS for more than 20 seconds and switch into Dead Reckoning mode until GPS signal is regained.</li>
</ol>
Here's what the failsafe <strong>will not do</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Detect if one more more individual RC channel has failed or become disconnected</li>
	<li>Detect if you're flying too far away or are about to hit the ground</li>
	<li>Detect autopilot hardware failures, such as low-power brownouts or in-air reboots</li>
	<li>Detect if the Plane software is not operating correctly</li>
	<li>Detect other problems with the aircraft, such as motor failures or low battery situations (although the latter can be set up through the main code if you have the right voltage/current sensor)</li>
	<li>Otherwise stop you from making setup or flight mistakes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Throttle Failsafe</h3>
<strong>How it works.</strong> Your RC transmitter outputs a PWM signal that is captured by your receiver and relayed to the autopilot. Each channel on your transmitter has a PWM range usually between 1100 - 1900 with 1500 being its neutral position. When you start your radio calibration on the mission planner, all your values will be at 1500. By moving your sticks, knobs and switches you will set your PWM range for each channel. The autopilot monitors your throttle channel and if it notices a drop lower than THR_FS_VALUE (Default is 950) it will go into failsafe mode.

RC transmitters usually have a default range for each channel that goes from -100% to 100%, however most transmitters will allow you to extend this to -150% and 150% respectively. In the default setup, bringing your throttle to -100% will translate to a value close to 1100 and bringing it to -150% will translate to a value closer to 900. What we want to achieve is to let your receiver know that the throttle can go as low as -150% but keep the autopilot control range between -100% and 100%. Meaning that when flying, our throttle values will range between 1100 - 1900.
<ul>
	<li>If we lose RC communication, the receiver if set up properly, will drop to the lowest known throttle value of ~900. This value falls bellow the THR_FS_VALUE and will trigger the autopilot to go into failsafe mode.</li>
	<li>First the autopilot will go into short failsafe (FS_SHORT_ACTN, 0=Disabled, 1=Enabled) when it detects loss of signal for more than 1.5 sec. The default setting for short failsafe is Circle mode.</li>
	<li>If the RC signal is regained during the short failsafe, the flight will return to auto mode.</li>
	<li>If the loss of signal is longer than 20 sec the autopilot will go into long failsafe (FS_LONG_ACTN, 0=Disabled, 1=Enabled).</li>
	<li>The default setting for long failsafe is RTL (Return to Launch).</li>
	<li>Once the long failsafe (RTL mode) has been entered at the conclusion of the short failsafe the RTL mode will continue even if your RC signal is reacquired.</li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Warning: In firmware releases prior to 2.75 there is a bug where the short failsafe goes to RTL mode instead of circle mode potentially resulting in a repeating loop mode failure.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>This will be fixed and short failsafe will correctly go to circle mode as of version 2.75 of Plane firmware.</strong></span></li>

<strong>Setup.</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Enable throttle failsafe by setting THR_FS_Value to 1 (0=Disabled, 1=Enabled).</li>
	<li>First turn on your transmitter and enable the throttle range to extend past -100%, we want to extend the throttle range past its low threshold.</li>
	<li>Once this is done, bind with your receiver. This will let your receiver know the lowest possible value for your throttle channel.</li>
	<li>Next revert the first change you made to the transmitter to limit the throttle to the original range.</li>
	<li>Do the radio calibration using the Mission Planner.</li>
	<li>Once the radio calibration is completed, drop the throttle on your transmitter and read what PWM value is being outputted to the mission planner on that channel.</li>
	<li>Turn off the transmitter. You should see the value drop significantly. This will be the PWM value relayed to the autopilot in the event RC link was lost during flight.</li>
	<li>Make sure THR_FS_VALUE is an adequate number to trigger the failsafe function on the autopilot.</li>
	<li>Make sure FS_SHORT_ACTN and FS_LONG_ACTN are both enabled (set to 1).</li>
	<li>Connect on the mission planner with your RC transmitter on. Verify on the bottom right corner of the HUD that you are “flying” in a non auto mode (Manual, Stabilize, FBW are ok).</li>
	<li>Turn off your transmitter. After 1.5 sec the flight mode should switch to Circle. After 20 sec the flight mode should switch to RTL. If you observe this behavior, your failsafe function has been set up correctly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>GCS Failsafe</h3>
<strong>How it works.</strong> When flying while using telemetry on the GCS, the autopilot can be programmed to trigger into failsafe mode if it loses telemetry. In the event that the autopilot stops receiving MAVlink (telemetry protocol) heartbeat messages for more than 20 sec, the GCS failsafe (FS_GCS_ENABL, 0=Disabled, 1=Enabled) will trigger the autopilot to go into long failsafe and change the flight mode to RTL.

<strong>Setup.</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Set FS_GCS_ENABL to 1 to enable it.</li>
	<li>Connect to the Mission Planner via telemetry. Verify on the bottom right corner of the HUD that you are “flying” in a non auto mode (Manual, Stabilize, FBW are ok).</li>
	<li>Unplug one of the telemetry radios. After a few minutes power off your autopilot. (Remember the autopilot will not go into failsafe until 20 seconds of MAVlink inactivity have passed).</li>
	<li>Connect your autopilot to the mission planner and pull the logs. Verify on the log that the autopilot went into RTL after 20 sec of MAVlink inactivity.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Failsafe Parameters and their meanings</h3>
<h3>Short failsafe action (Plane:FS_SHORT_ACTN)</h3>
The action to take on a short (1.5 seconds) failsafe event in AUTO, GUIDED or LOITER modes. A short failsafe event in stabilization modes will always cause a change to CIRCLE mode. In AUTO mode you can choose whether it will RTL (ReturnToLaunch) or continue with the mission. If FS_SHORT_ACTN is 0 then it will continue with the mission, if it is 1 then it will enter CIRCLE mode, and then enter RTL if the failsafe condition persists for 20 seconds.

<h3>Long failsafe action (Plane:FS_LONG_ACTN)</h3>
The action to take on a long (20 second) failsafe event in AUTO, GUIDED or LOITER modes. A long failsafe event in stabilization modes will always cause an RTL (ReturnToLaunch). In AUTO modes you can choose whether it will RTL or continue with the mission. If FS_LONG_ACTN is 0 then it will continue with the mission, if it is 1 then it will enter RTL mode. Note that if FS_SHORT_ACTN is 1, then the aircraft will enter CIRCLE mode after 1.5 seconds of failsafe, and will always enter RTL after 20 seconds of failsafe, regardless of the FS_LONG_ACTN setting.

<h3>Failsafe battery voltage (Plane:FS_BATT_VOLTAGE)</h3>
Battery voltage to trigger failsafe. Set to 0 to disable battery voltage failsafe. If the battery voltage drops below this voltage then the plane will RTL

<h3>Failsafe battery milliAmpHours (Plane:FS_BATT_MAH)</h3>
Battery capacity remaining to trigger failsafe. Set to 0 to disable battery remaining failsafe. If the battery remaining drops below this level then the plane will RTL

	<li>Units: mAh</li>
</ul>
<h3>GCS failsafe enable (Plane:FS_GCS_ENABL)</h3>
Enable ground control station telemetry failsafe. Failsafe will trigger after 20 seconds of no MAVLink heartbeat messages. WARNING: Enabling this option opens up the possibility of your plane going into failsafe mode and running the motor on the ground it it loses contact with your ground station. If this option is enabled on an electric plane then either use a separate motor arming switch or remove the propeller in any ground testing.
