This article explains how to set up and use a combined fixed wing and quadcopter aircraft, also known as a "QuadPlane".

<a href="http://plane.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/scaled_IMG_20150830_093548.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-9664"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9664" src="http://plane.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/12/scaled_IMG_20150830_093548.jpg" alt="scaled_IMG_20150830_093548" width="600" height="450" /></a>
<h1>Overview</h1>
A QuadPlane is a combined fixed wing and QuadCopter aircraft. This sort of aircraft brings the benefit of vertical takeoff and landing, significantly greater speed and range of travel, and the ability to hover and perform copter-like tasks at the destination (limited by available power).

QuadPlane is built upon Plane, but adds control over 4 horizontal rotors (as shown in the preceding diagram). Additional modes and commands allow QuadPlane to be take off, land and fly like a copter, and to smoothly transition between the Plane and Copter-like modes in both automatic and autopilot-assisted modes. The additional rotors can also provide lift and stability in normal Plane modes.

Support for QuadPlane simulation is available in SITL.
<h1>Getting the code</h1>
QuadPlane support is in <a href="http://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot">ArduPilot master</a>, in the ArduPlane directory. It is included in the 3.5.0beta series of releases. The normal instructions for building Plane apply.

Prebuilt binaries for Pixhawk and other platforms are in the 'latest' or 'beta' releases of ArduPlane on <a href="http://firmware.diydrones.com">http://firmware.diydrones.com</a>
<h1>Flight modes</h1>
The QuadPlane code is based upon the Plane master firmware but with 3 extra modes:
<ul>
	<li>mode 17: QSTABILIZE (like <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/stabilize-mode/">Copter STABILIZE</a>)</li>
	<li>mode 18: QHOVER (like <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/altholdmode/">Copter ALT_HOLD</a>)</li>
	<li>mode 19: QLOITER (like <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/loiter-mode/">Copter LOITER</a>)</li>
</ul>
[tip]You will probably need to set the <code>FLTMODE*</code> parameters for these extra modes as numeric values as your GCS won't understand these values yet.[/tip]

If you are familiar with the equivalent Copter flight modes then you should be comfortable flying a QuadPlane. The only real difference comes during transition between fixed wing and QuadPlane flight, which is described below.

[note]The landing detection logic in QLOITER mode is not as sophisticated as the landing detection logic in Copter, so if you get GPS movement while on the ground in QLOITER mode then the aircraft may try to tip over as it tries to hold position while in contact with the ground. It is suggested that you switch to QHOVER or QSTABILIZE once landed as these are unaffected by GPS movement.[/note]
<h1>Frame setup</h1>
The code defaults to a Quad-X frame for the quad part of the aircraft, with the motors on outputs 5 to 8. The arrangement is:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Channel 5:</strong> Front right motor</li>
	<li><strong>Channel 6:</strong> Rear left motor</li>
	<li><strong>Channel 7:</strong> Front left motor</li>
	<li><strong>Channel 8:</strong> Rear right motor</li>
</ul>
The normal plane outputs are assumed to be on 1 to 4 as usual. Only outputs 5 to 8 run at high PWM rate (400Hz). You can also use channels 9 to 14 in any way you like, just as with the normal Plane code.

You can optionally move the quad motors to be on any other channel above 4, using the procedure outlined below.
<h2>Using different channel mappings</h2>
You can remap what output channels the quad motors are on by setting values for RCn_FUNCTION. This follows the same approach as <a href="http://plane.ardupilot.com/wiki/channel-output-functions/">other output functions</a>.

The output function numbers are:
<ul>
	<li>33: motor1</li>
	<li>34: motor2</li>
	<li>35: motor3</li>
	<li>36: motor4</li>
</ul>
So to put your quad motors on outputs 9 to 12 (the auxillary channels on a Pixhawk) you would use these settings in the advanced parameter list:
<ul>
	<li>RC9_FUNCTION = 33</li>
	<li>RC10_FUNCTION = 34</li>
	<li>RC11_FUNCTION = 35</li>
	<li>RC12_FUNCTION = 36</li>
</ul>
<h1>ESC calibration</h1>
Most models of PWM based ESC need to be calibrated to ensure that all the ESCs respond to the same input with the same speed. To calibrate them they need to receive maximum PWM input when initially powered on, then receive minimum PWM input when they have beeped to indicate that the maximum has registered.

The quadplane code doesn't have a dedicated ESC calibration feature yet, but you can use the following procedure to calibrate until that is available:
<ol>
	<li>remove your propellers for safety</li>
	<li>power up just the flight board and not your motors. If you don't have the ability to isolate power to the ESCs when on battery power then power up your flight board on USB power</li>
	<li>set both the parameters Q_M_SPIN_ARMED and Q_THR_MID to 1000. This sets the PWM output when armed at zero throttle to full power</li>
	<li>set the safety switch off to activate the outputs</li>
	<li>arm your aircraft. The PWM output on all quad motors will now climb to maximum.</li>
	<li>add power to your ESCs by connecting the battery</li>
	<li>wait for the ESCs to beep to indicate they have registered the maximum PWM</li>
	<li>disarm your aircraft. The ESCs should beep again indicating they have registered minimum PWM</li>
</ol>
Now set the Q_M_SPIN_ARMED and Q_THR_MID parameters back to the correct values. A value of 50 for Q_M_SPIN_ARMED is a reasonable starting point. For Q_THR_MID a value of between 500 and 600 is good depending on the power of your motors
<h1>Transition</h1>
You can transition between any modes, fixed wing or QuadPlane just by changing mode. The transition rules are:
<ul>
	<li>If you transition to <a href="manual-mode">MANUAL</a> then the quad motors will immediately stop.</li>
	<li>If you transition to any other fixed wing mode then the quad will continue to supply lift and stability until you have reached the <a href="arduplane-parameters/#minimum_airspeed_arduplanearspd_fbw_min">ARSPD_FBW_MIN</a> airspeed (or airspeed estimate if no airspeed sensor).</li>
	<li>Once that airspeed is reached the quad motors will slowly drop in power over Q_TRANSITION_MS milliseconds (default is 5000, so 5 seconds) and will switch off after that</li>
</ul>
If you transition from a fixed wing mode to a QuadPlane mode then the fixed wing motor will immediately stop, but the control surfaces will continue to provide stability while the plane slows down. This allows for transitions to QuadPlane modes while flying at high speed.

[note]If you transition to QLOITER while flying at high speed then the loiter code will try to bring the aircraft to a very rapid stop which will cause the plane to pitch up hard and then fly backwards to get back to the point where QLOITER was entered. Unless you are sure of the strength of your airframe it would be a good idea to transition to QHOVER first which will result in a much gentler transition, then move to QLOITER once the aircraft has slowed down.[/note]
<h1>Parameter setup</h1>
All QuadPlane specific parameters start with a "Q_" prefix. The parameters are very similar to the equivalent Copter parameters so if you are familiar with those you should find setting up a QuadPlane is easy.

Key parameters are:
<ul>
	<li>To enable QuadPlane functionality you need to set the Q_ENABLE parameter to 1 and then refresh the parameter list</li>
	<li>The Q_THR_MIN_PWM and Q_THR_MAX_PWM parameters used to set the PWM range of the quad motors (this allows them to be different from the range for the forward motor). These need to be set to the range your ESCs expect.</li>
	<li>You should set <a href="arduplane-parameters/#scheduling_main_loop_rate_sched_loop_rate">SCHED_LOOP_RATE</a> to 300 so the code runs the main loop at 300Hz, which is a good rate for both fixed wing and quadplane VTOL.</li>
	<li>The most critical tuning parameters are Q_RT_RLL_P and Q_RT_PIT_P. These default to 0.15 (same as Copter) but you may find significantly higher values are needed for a QuadPlane.</li>
	<li>The Q_M_SPIN_ARMED parameter is important for getting the right level of motor output when armed in a quad mode</li>
	<li>It is recommended that you set ARMING_RUDDER to 2 to allow for rudder disarm. Alternatively you could have <a href="manual-mode">MANUAL</a> as one of your available flight modes (as that will shut down the quad motors). Please be careful not to use hard left rudder and zero throttle while flying or you risk disarming your motors.</li>
	<li>The Q_THR_MID parameter is important for smooth transitions. It defaults to 500 which means 50% throttle for hover. If your aircraft needs more or less than 50% throttle to hover then please adjust this. That will prevent a throttle surge during transition as the altitude controller learns the right throttle level</li>
</ul>
[note]The QuadPlane code requires GPS lock for proper operation. This is inherited from the plane code, which disables intertial estimation of attitude and position if GPS lock is not available. Do not try to fly a QuadPlane indoors. It will not fly well[/note]
<h1>Assisted fixed-wing flight</h1>
The QuadPlane code can also be configured to provide assistance to the fixed wing code in any flight mode except <a href="manual-mode">MANUAL</a>. To enable quad assistance you should set Q_ASSIST_SPEED parameter to the airspeed below which you want assistance.

When Q_ASSIST_SPEED is non-zero then the quad motors will assist with both stability and lift whenever the airspeed drops below that threshold. This can be used to allow flying at very low speeds in <a href="fbwa-mode">FBWA</a> mode for example, or for assisted automatic fixed wing takeoffs.

It is suggested that you do initial flights with <code>Q_ASSIST_SPEED=0</code> just to test the basic functionality and tune the airframe. Then try with Q_ASSIST_SPEED above plane stall speed if you want that functionality.

What assistance the quad motors provides depends on the fixed wing flight mode. If you are flying in an autonomous or semi-autonomous mode then the quad motors will try to assist with whatever climb rate and turn rate the autonomous flight mode wants. In a manually navigated mode the quad will try to provide assistance that fits with the pilot inputs.

The specific handling is:
<ul>
	<li>In <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> mode the quad will provide lift to get to the altitude of the next waypoint, and will help turn the aircraft at the rate the navigation controller is demanding.</li>
	<li>In fixed wing <a href="loiter-mode">LOITER</a>, <a href="rtl-mode">RTL</a> or GUIDED modes the quad motors will try to assist with whatever climb rate and turn rate the navigation controller is asking for.</li>
	<li>In <a href="cruise-mode">CRUISE</a> or <a href="fbwb-mode">FBWB</a> mode the quad will provide lift according to the pilots demanded climb rate (controlled with pitch stick). The quad motors will try to turn at the pilot demanded turn rate (combining aileron and rudder input).</li>
	<li>In <a href="fbwa-mode">FBWA</a> mode the quad will assume that pitch stick input is proportional to the climb rate the user wants. So if the user pulls back on the pitch stick the quad motors will try to climb, and if the user pushes forward on the pitch stick the quad motors will try to provide a stable descent.</li>
	<li>In <a href="autotune-mode">AUTOTUNE</a> mode the quad will provide the same assistance as in <a href="fbwa-mode">FBWA</a>, but it is not a good idea to use <a href="autotune-mode">AUTOTUNE</a> mode with a high value of Q_ASSIST_SPEED as the quad assistance will interfere with the learning of the fixed wing gains.</li>
	<li>In <a href="manual-mode">MANUAL</a>, <a href="acro-mode">ACRO</a> and <a href="training-mode">TRAINING</a> modes the quad motors will completely turn off. In those modes the aircraft will fly purely as a fixed wing.</li>
	<li>In <a href="stabilize-mode">STABILIZE</a> mode the quad motors will try to provide lift if assistance is turned on.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Autonomous flight</h1>
You can also ask the QuadPlane code to fly <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> missions. To do that you plan an <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> mission as usual and send a DO_VTOL_TRANSITION with parameter 1 equal to 3 to ask the aircraft to switch to VTOL mode while flying the mission. When you do that the fixed wing motor will stop and the aircraft will continue the mission as a quadcopter. You can then send a DO_VTOL_TRANSITION with parameter 1 equal to 4 to switch back to fixed wing flight.

The smooth transition rules apply to transitions in <a href="auto-mode">AUTO</a> mode as they do for other modes, plus quad assistance applies in auto fixed-wing mode if Q_ASSIST_SPEED is enabled.

In addition to DO_VTOL_TRANSITION the QuadPlane code supports two new mission commands:
<ul>
	<li>NAV_VTOL_TAKEOFF</li>
	<li>NAV_VTOL_LAND</li>
</ul>
These mission commands can be used as part of a full auto mission to give a vertical takeoff, followed by smooth transition to auto fixed wing flight and then a vertical landing.
<h1>What will happen?</h1>
Understanding hybrid aircraft can be difficult at first, so below are some scenarios and how the ArduPilot code will handle them.
<h2>I am hovering in QHOVER and switch to FBWA mode</h2>
The aircraft will continue to hover, waiting for pilot input. If you take your hands off the sticks at zero throttle the aircraft will continue to hold the current height and hold itself level. It will drift with the wind as it is not doing position hold.

If you advance the throttle stick then the forward motor will start and the aircraft will start to move forward. The quad motors will continue to provide both lift and stability while the aircraft is moving slowly. You can control the attitude of the aircraft with roll and pitch stick input. When you use the pitch stick (elevator) that will affect the climb rate of the quad motors. If you pull back on the elevator the quad motors will assist with the aircraft climb. If you push forward on the pitch stick the power to the quad motors will decrease and the aircraft will descend.

The roll and pitch input also controls the attitude of the aircraft, so a right roll at low speed will cause the aircraft to move to the right. It will also cause the aircraft to yaw to the right (as the QuadPlane code interprets right aileron in fixed wing mode as a commanded turn).

Once the aircraft reaches an airspeed of <a href="arduplane-parameters/#minimum_airspeed_arduplanearspd_fbw_min">ARSPD_FBW_MIN</a> (or Q_ASSIST_SPEED if that is set and is greater than <a href="arduplane-parameters/#minimum_airspeed_arduplanearspd_fbw_min">ARSPD_FBW_MIN</a>) the amount of assistance the quad motors provide will decrease over 5 seconds. After that time the aircraft will be flying purely as a fixed wing.
<h2>I am flying fast in FBWA mode and switch to QHOVER mode</h2>
The quad motors will immediately engage and will start by holding the aircraft at the current height. The climb/descent rate is now set by the throttle stick, with a higher throttle stick meaning climb and a lower throttle stick meaning descend. At mid-stick the aircraft will hold altitude.

The forward motor will stop, but the aircraft will continue to move forward due to its momentum. The drag of the air will slowly bring it to a stop. The attitude of the aircraft can be controlled with roll and pitch sticks (aileron and elevator). You can yaw the aircraft with rudder.
<h2>I am flying fast in FBWA mode and switch to QLOITER mode</h2>
The quad motors will immediately engage and the aircraft will pitch up hard, as it tries to hold position at the position it was in when you switched to QLOITER mode.

The aircraft will stop very quickly, and will back up slightly to the position where QLOITER was entered. The movement of the aircraft can be controlled with roll and pitch sticks (aileron and elevator). You can yaw the aircraft with rudder.

The climb/descent rate is now set by the throttle stick, with a higher throttle stick meaning climb and a lower throttle stick meaning descend. At mid-stick the aircraft will hold altitude.
<h2>I switch to RTL mode while hovering</h2>
The aircraft will transition to fixed wing flight. The quad motors will provide assistance with lift and attitude while the forward motor starts to pull the aircraft forward.

The normal Plane RTL flight plan will then be run, which defaults to circling at the RTL altitude above the arming position or nearest rally point. If you have <a href="arduplane-parameters/#rtl_auto_land_arduplanertl_autoland">RTL_AUTOLAND</a> setup then the aircraft will do a fixed wing landing.

When the aircraft is close to home you could switch it to QHOVER or QLOITER to land vertically.
<h1>Typical flight</h1>
A typical test flight would be:
<ul>
	<li>takeoff in QLOITER or QHOVER</li>
	<li>switch to <a href="fbwa-mode">FBWA</a> mode and advance throttle to start flying fixed wing</li>
	<li>switch to QHOVER mode to go back to quad mode.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Simulation</h1>
A simple QuadPlane model is available in SITL, allowing you to test the features of the QuadPlane code without risking a real aircraft.

You can start it like this:
<pre>sim_vehicle.sh -j4 -f quadplane --console --map</pre>
A parameter file to setup your QuadPlane is in <strong>Tools/autotest</strong>:
<pre>param load ../Tools/autotest/quadplane.parm</pre>
To visualise the aircraft you can use FlightGear in view-only mode. The simulation will output FlightGear compatible state on UDP port 5503. Start FlightGear using the <strong>fg_plane_view.sh</strong> scripts provided in the <strong>Tools/autotest</strong> directory.

Note that to get good scenery for FlightGear it is best to use a major airport. I tend to test at San Francisco airport, like this:
<pre>sim_vehicle.sh -L KSFO -f quadplane --console --map</pre>
Using the joystick module with a USB adapter for your transmitter gives a convenient way to get used to the QuadPlane controls before flying.

If flying at KSFO there is a sample mission available with VTOL takeoff and landing:
<pre>wp load ../Tools/autotest/ArduPlane-Missions/KSFO-VTOL.txt</pre>
As usual you can edit the mission using "module load misseditor"
