The antenna tracker firmware can be loaded from the Mission Planner's <strong>Initial Setup | Install Firmware</strong> very <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-loading-firmware-onto-pixhawk/">much like Copter.</a>

<h1>Use Mission Planner's Install Firmware screen to load the firmware</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Connect the flight control board to the computer using the mini USB cable</li>
	<li>Select the appropriate COM port on the top right of the screen but do not push the Connect button</li>
	<li>From the <strong>Initial Setup | Install Firmware</strong> page click on the "Antenna Tracker" icon on the bottom left.Â  Follow any instructions that appear and after a minute or so the firmware should be uploaded and you should be able to connect with the mission planner and see the Flight Data screen's HUD update.</li>
</ul>
[note]Because the EEPROM format is different between the Antenna Tracker firmware and any flight controller software that was previously installed on the board (i.e. Copter or Plane) it is likely the EEPROM will have been erased by the firmware upload.[/note]

[note]Firmware for other boards (APM1, Flymaple, etc) cannot be loaded directly from the mission planner but must be compiled and loaded onto the board more manually.[/note]
