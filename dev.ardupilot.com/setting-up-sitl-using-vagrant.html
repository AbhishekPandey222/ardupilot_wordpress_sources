[warning]At time of writing there is <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/3249">issue</a> with staring SITL. Instead of the original instructions, you will have to log into vagrant specify the path to <strong>sim_vehicle.sh</strong> as shown.
<pre>vagrant ssh
sudo /vagrant/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.sh</pre>[/warning]
This article explains how to set up the <a title="SITL Simulator (Software in the Loop)" href="sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop">SITL ArduPilot Simulator</a> in a virtual machine environment using <a title="Vagrant Tool" href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>, and connect it to a Ground Control Station running on the host computer. This approach is much easier and faster than <a title="Setting up SITL on Windows" href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/simulation-2/setting-up-sitl-on-windows/">manually</a> setting up a virtual machine to run SITL on Mac OSX or Windows (or Linux).
<!--more-->
These instructions have been tested on Windows 8.1.

<h1>Overview</h1>
The SITL (Software In The Loop) simulator allows you to run Plane, Copter or Rover without any hardware. The simulator runs the normal ArduPilot code as a native executable on a Linux PC. SITL can also be run within a virtual machine on Windows, Mac OSX or Linux. 

Vagrant is a tool for automating setting up and configuring development environments running in virtual machines. While it is possible to <a title="Setting up SITL on Windows" href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/simulation-2/setting-up-sitl-on-windows/">manually set up SITL to run in a VM on Windows</a> (or Mac OSX), it is <strong>much easier</strong> (and more reproducible) to use Vagrant to do this work for you.


<h1>Preconditions</h1>
<ul>
	<li><em>Git</em> (<strong>1.8.x or later</strong>) must be installed on the host computer.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://msysgit.github.io/">Git for Windows</a> (1.9.5) is recommended.
[note]The current windows px4 toolchain (v14) does not have a recent enough version of GIT[/note][warning]You must use the newer version for the git submodule init step. After that setp you can use an older version.[/warning] </li>
	<li>Ensure that <em>git</em> is set to leave line endings untouched. Click on your new “Git Shell (or Bash)” Icon (the terminal was installed when you installed git) and type in the following in the Git “MINGW32″ Terminal window:
<pre>git config --global core.autocrlf false</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><em>SSH</em> must be installed on the host computer and be added to the system PATH. SSH is installed with GIT, or you can install it independently for your platform.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Building PX4 Firmware - Rsync</h2>

If you're using this Vagrant file for the purpose of building PX4 firmware you will probably also wish to install <em>Rsync</em>, as this significantly speeds up PX4 builds. The relative build times using different approaches (on a 3Ghz i5 Haswell / 16 Gb) are shown below:
<ul>
	<li>Native windows px4 toolchain (gcc/mingw): 190 minutes</li>
	<li>Vagrant with shared folders (the default setup described here): 15 minutes 30s (12x faster)</li>
	<li>Vagrant with rsync folders: 1 minute 40s (120x faster)!.</li>
</ul>

[tip]Everything is set up to use shared folders by default. The only caveat is that <code>px4-clean</code> <em>does not work with shared folders</em>. You either need to use rsync or run <code>px4-clean</code> from outside Vagrant (you can also get usable results by cd'ing to each module subdirectory and running<code> git clean -x -d -f</code> but don't do this from the top level otherwise you will delete your vagrant temporary files.[/tip]

If you want to use rsync you need to:
<ul>
	<li>Uncomment the <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L37">appropriate line</a> in the Vagrantfile:
<pre># config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "rsync", rsync__auto: true</pre></li>

<li><em>rsync</em> must be installed on the host computer and be added to the system PATH. According to <a title="Vagrant rsync guide" href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/rsync.html" target="_blank">the vagrant rsync guide</a> you can install rsync from either <a title="Mingw download link" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/" target="_blank">Mingw</a> or <a href="https://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>. Assuming you're using Mingw:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Mingw download link" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/" target="_blank">Download the latest Mingw installer</a></li>
	<li>In the installer, select and install the <em>mingw-developer-toolkit</em>

	<li>Use <em>mingw-get</em> to install rsync (you may need to add <em>mingw-get</em> to your path):
<pre>mingw-get install msys-rsync</pre>
</li>
	<li>Set the system path to point to rsync (By default this is in <strong>C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin</strong>.)</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>







<h1>Set up the Vagrant and the virtual machine</h1>
<ol>
	<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Download and install VirtualBox</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Download and install Vagrant</a> for your platform. Windows, OS-X and Linux are supported.</li>
	<li>Clone the <a title="ArduPilot on Github" href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot" target="_blank">ArduPilot</a> Github repository anywhere on your PC:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot.git</pre>
</li>
	<li>Start a vagrant instance
<ul>
	<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to any directory in the <a title="SITL vagrant set up source tree" href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/vagrant/" target="_blank">/diydrones/ardupilot/Tools/vagrant/</a> source tree.</li>
	<li>Run the command:
<pre>vagrant up</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
This starts running a VM, based on a <em>Vagrant configuration file</em> in the source tree. All the files in this directory tree will "magically" appear inside the running instance at <em>/vagrant</em>.

[note]The first time you run the vagrant up command it will take some time complete. The command needs to fetch a Vagrant base VM and configure it with the development environment.[/note]
<h1>Start running SITL</h1>
Enter the following in your vagrant shell to run the Copter simulator. This will first build the code (if it has not previously been built) and then run the simulator:
<pre>vagrant ssh -c "sim_vehicle.sh -j 2"</pre>
Once the simulation is running, you will start getting information from the MAVLink prompt about vehicle state. For example:
<pre>GPS lock at 0 meters
APM: PreArm: RC not calibrated
APM: Copter V3.3-dev (999710d0)
APM: Frame: QUAD
APM: PreArm: RC not calibrated
</pre>
The Copter Simulator is built by default, but you can instead build for the plane or rover using the <code>-v</code> option:
<pre>vagrant ssh -c "sim_vehicle.sh -j 2 -v Plane"
vagrant ssh -c "sim_vehicle.sh -j 2 -v APMrover2"</pre>


[tip]<a title="sim_vehicle.sh" href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.sh">sim_vehicle.sh</a> has many useful build options, ranging from setting the simulation speed through to choosing the initial vehicle location. These can be listed by calling it with the <code>-h</code> flag (and some are demonstrated in <a href="using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing">Using SITL for ArduPilot Testing</a>).[/tip]

<h1>Run Mission Planner or MAVProxy in your main OS</h1>
You can now connect to the running simulator from your main OS. Just connect to UDP port 14550, either from <em>Mission Planner</em> or <em>MAVProxy</em>. The <em>MAVProxy</em> command is:
<pre>mavproxy.py --master=127.0.0.1:14550</pre>
<h1>Shutting down the simulator</h1>
When you are done with the simulator:
<ul>
	<li>Press <strong>ctrl-d</strong> in the Vagrant SSH window to exit the special <em>MAVProxy</em> that is gluing everything together.</li>
	<li>Suspend the running VM by entering the following in the command prompt:
<pre>vagrant suspend</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Restarting the simulator</h1>
When you need the simulator again you can resume the VM and restart the simulator as shown:
<pre>vagrant up
vagrant ssh -c "sim_vehicle.sh -j 2"
</pre>
[note]Restarting the environment usually only takes a few seconds as the VM is only suspended and the simulation code for the vehicle has already been built.[/note]
<h1>Updating the simulator</h1>
The simulator is built from the source tree shared between the host and virtual machines, and any changes will trigger a rebuild next time you start the simulator. To update the simulator you simply need to modify the source tree (or pull a new version from Github).

The topic <a title="Using SITL for ArduPilot Testing" href="using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing">Using SITL for ArduPilot Testing</a> explains how to use the simulator, and covers topics like how to use SITL with Ground Stations other than Mission Planner and MAVProxy.
