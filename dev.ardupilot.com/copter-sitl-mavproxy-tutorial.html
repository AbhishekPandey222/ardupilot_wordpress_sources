This tutorial provides a basic walk-through of how to use <a href="sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop">SITL</a> and <a href="http://tridge.github.io/MAVProxy/">MAVProxy</a> for <em>Copter</em> testing.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The article is intended primarily for developers who want to test new Copter builds and bug fixes using SITL and <em>MAVProxy</em>. It shows how to take off, fly in <code>GUIDED</code> mode, run missions, set a geofence, and perform a number of other basic testing tasks.

The tutorial is complementary to the topic <a href="using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing">Using SITL for ArduPilot Testing</a>.

[note]<ul>
	<li>We use <em>MAVProxy</em> here, but you can <a href="using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing/#connecting_otheradditional_ground_stations">attach another ground station to SITL</a> if you prefer (similar instructions can be used in any GCS).</li>
        <li>This tutorial is for Copter - see <a href="plane-sitlmavproxy-tutorial">Plane</a> and Rover for similar tutorials on the other vehicles.</li>
</ul>

[/note]


<h1>Preconditions</h1>

The tutorial assumes you have already set up <a href="sitl-native-on-windows">SITL on Windows</a> or <a href="setting-up-sitl-on-linux">Linux</a> and that you have started SITL using the <code>--map</code> and <code>--console</code> options:
<pre>cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter
sim_vehicle.sh -j4 --map --console</pre>
As part of the setup you should have loaded some standard/test parameters into the <em>MAVProxy Command Prompt</em>:
<pre>param load ..\Tools\autotest\copter_params.parm</pre>
The <em>MAVProxy Command Prompt</em>, <em>Console</em> and <em>Map</em> should be arranged conveniently so you can observe the status and send commands at the same time.

<h1>Taking off</h1>

This section explains how to take off in <code>GUIDED</code> mode. The main steps are to change to <code>GUIDED</code> mode, arm the throttle, and then call the <code>takeoff</code> command. Takeoff must start within 15 seconds of arming, or the motors will disarm!

[note]At time of writing, Copter only supports takeoff in guided mode; if you want to fly a mission you first have to take off and then switch to <code>AUTO</code> mode. From AC3.3 it will be possible to take off in AUTO mode too.[/note]

Enter the following commands in the <em>MAVProxy Command Prompt</em>.
<pre>mode guided 
arm throttle
takeoff 40
</pre>
Copter should take off to an altitude of 40 metres and then hover (while it waits for the next command).



<h2>Monitoring</h2>

During takeoff you can watch the altitude increase on the console in the <em>Alt</em> field.

Developers may find it useful to <strong>graph</strong> the takeoff by first entering the <code>gtakeoff</code> command.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
The most common sources of difficulty taking off are:
<ol>
	<li>Starting in any mode other than <code>GUIDED</code>.</li>
	<li>Attempting to takeoff when the vehicle is not armed. This can happen if you call <code>takeoff</code> too slowly after <code>arm throttle</code>, or if the vehicle fails pre-arm checks.</li>
</ol>
You can list all <em>enabled</em> checks using the command <code>arm list</code>:
<pre>LAND&gt; arm list
LAND&gt; all
params
voltage
compass
battery
ins
rc
baro
gps
</pre>
You can enable and disable checks using <code>arm check n</code> and <code>arm uncheck n</code> respectively, where n is the name of the check. Use <code>n</code> value of of <code>all</code> to enables/disable all checks.



<h1>Changing flight mode - circle and land</h1>

The command below shows how to put Copter into <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/flying-arducopter/flight-modes/wiki/circle-mode/">CIRCLE</a> mode with a <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/configuration/arducopter-parameters/#circle_radius_circle_radius">CIRCLE_RADIUS</a> of 2000cm. This will fly the Copter in a circle at a constant altitude, with the front pointed towards the centre of the circle.
<pre>mode circle
param set circle_radius 2000
</pre>
[note]If you set the <code>CIRCLE_RADIUS</code> to zero the vehicle will rotate in place.[/note]

Copter supports a <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/flying-arducopter/flight-modes/">number of other flight modes</a>, which you can list in MAVProxy using the <code>mode</code> command:
<pre>LAND&gt; mode
LAND&gt; ('Available modes: ', ['RTL', 'POSHOLD', 'LAND', 'OF_LOITER', 'STABILIZE', 'AUTO', 'GUIDED', 'DRIFT', 'FLIP', 'AUTOTUNE', 'ALT_HOLD', 'LOITER', 'POSITION', 'CIRCLE', 'SPORT', 'ACRO'])
</pre>
As shown above, you can change the mode by specifying <code>mode <em>modename</em></code>. Many of the modes can be set by just entering the mode name, e.g. <code>rtl</code>, <code>auto</code>, <code>stabilize</code> etc.

For example, to land right where you are you would use the command: <code>mode land</code>. To return to the launch point and then land you would use the command: <code>rtl</code>.


<h1>Guiding the vehicle</h1>
Once you've taken off you can move the vehicle around the map in <code>GUIDED</code> mode. The easiest way to do this is to right-click on the map where you want to go, select <strong>Fly to</strong>, and then enter the target altitude.

[caption id="attachment_5614" align="alignnone" width="545"]<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/05/MAVProxyCopter_flyto.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5614" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/05/MAVProxyCopter_flyto.png" alt="MAVProxy: Fly to Location" width="545" height="591" /></a> MAVProxy: Fly to Location[/caption]

You can also enter the target position manually on the command line using the two formats below. If only the altitude is specified, the last specified LAT/LON will be used.
<pre>guided ALTITUDE
guided LAT LON ALTITUDE
</pre>

In addition to <code>takeoff</code>, you can send the following commands in <code>GUIDED</code> mode:
<pre>
yaw ANGLE ANGULAR_SPEED MODE  (MODE is 0 for "absolute" or 1 for "relative")
speed SPEED_VALUE
velocity x y z   (m/s)
</pre>

[note]These commands correspond to <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd/#mav_cmd_nav_takeoff">MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF</a>, <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd/#mav_cmd_do_change_speed">MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED</a>, <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd/#mav_cmd_condition_yaw">MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW</a>, <a href="http://mavlink.org/messages/common#SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED">SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED</a>.

At time of writing, the other <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/copter-commands-in-guided-mode/">Copter Commands</a> are not supported (<a href="https://github.com/Dronecode/MAVProxy/issues/150">MAVProxy #150</a>)[/note]


<h1>Flying a mission</h1>

You can load a mission at any time using the <code>wp load</code> command. After you've taken off the current mission will start as soon as you change to <code>AUTO</code> mode.

The example below shows how to load and start one of the test missions, skip to the second waypoint, and <em>loop</em> the mission:
<pre>wp load ..\Tools\autotest\CMAC-circuit.txt
mode auto
wp set 2
wp loop</pre>
The <a href="http://dronecode.github.io/MAVProxy/html/uav_configuration/waypoints.html">MAVProxy Waypoints documentation</a> lists the full set of available commands (or you can get them using auto-completion by typing "wp" on the command line).

If you want to create a waypoint mission, this is most easily done on the map:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click on the map and then select <strong>Mission | Draw</strong>.

[caption id="attachment_5615" align="alignnone" width="645"]<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/05/MAVProxyCopter_Mission_Draw.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-5615" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/05/MAVProxyCopter_Mission_Draw.png" alt="MAVProxy: Draw Mission Menu" width="645" height="637" /></a> MAVProxy: Draw Mission Menu[/caption]</li>
	<li>Left-click on the map where you want the points to appear.
[note]Nothing visible will happen when you make the first click. After the second click, lines will join your points to show the path[/note].</li>
	<li>When you're done, you can loop the mission by right-clicking on the map and selecting <strong>Mission | Loop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

This approach only allows you to create <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-planning-a-mission-with-waypoints-and-events/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd/#mav_cmd_nav_waypoint">MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT</a> commands. You can edit missions and use other commands on Linux using the <em>misseditor</em> module (<code>module load misseditor</code>). This is currently broken on Windows. It is also possible to load other types of commands from files.



<h1>Setting a GeoFence</h1>

A GeoFence is is a virtual barrier that Copter uses to constrain the movement of the vehicle. Copter uses a simple "tin can border" as described in <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/configuration/ac2_simple_geofence/">Simple GeoFence</a>. When the radius or maximum altitude is breached, Copter returns to the launch point and/or lands. 

The fence is enabled (and its type selected) using the <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/configuration/arducopter-parameters/#fence__parameters">Copter Fence Parameters</a>. You can list the fence parameters with <code>param show</code>:
<pre>
GUIDED> param show fence*
GUIDED> FENCE_ACTION     1.000000
FENCE_ALT_MAX    100.000000
FENCE_ENABLE     0.000000
FENCE_MARGIN     2.000000
FENCE_RADIUS     150.000000
FENCE_TYPE       3.000000
</pre>

The fence has an altitude boundary of 100 metres (<code>FENCE_ALT_MAX</code>) and is bound by a circle of radius <code>FENCE_RADIUS</code> around the home location. The <code>FENCE_TYPE=3</code> means that both the radius and altitude are used (you can change the type to other numbers have an altitude-only or circle only fence - or none at all).

The fence is initially disabled (<code>FENCE_ENABLE=0</code>). To turn it on we set the value to one:
<pre>
GUIDED> param set fence_enable 1
</pre>

When we fly outside the radius the mode changes to RTL (return to land). If for some reason we travel further out by the value of <code>FENCE_MARGIN</code>, then the vehicle will simply land.


<h1>Testing the vehicle</h1>

<em>MAVProxy</em> allows you to list all the parameters affecting the vehicle and simulation using <code>param show *</code>, and to set any parameter using: <code>param set PARAM_NAME VALUE</code>. In addition to affecting the vehicle itself some parameters simulate the performance/failure of specific hardware components and the environment (for example, the wind). These can be listed using: <code>param show sim*</code>.

The topic <a href="using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing">Using SITL for ArduPilot Testing</a> explains more about how you can test using SITL.
