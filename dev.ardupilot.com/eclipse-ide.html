Eclipse is the recommended editor for ArduPilot development on Windows.

The easiest way to set up Eclipse for ArduPilot development is to use the version (Eclipse "Luna") included with the PX4 Toolchain (this version can be used for both Pixhaw/PX4 and APM development). Instructions for the different controller boards are given below:
