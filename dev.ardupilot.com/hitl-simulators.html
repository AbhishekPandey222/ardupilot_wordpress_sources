Hardware In The Loop (HITL) simulation replaces the vehicle and the environment with a simulator (the Simulator has a high-fidelity aircraft dynamics model and environment model for wind, turbulence, etc.)  The physical AutoPilot hardware is configured exactly as for flight, and connects to your computer running the simulator (rather than the aircraft).

This section contains HITL simulation solutions.

[note]At time of writing X-Plane and Flightgear simulation for ArduPilot only support Plane (not Copter or Rover).[/note]
