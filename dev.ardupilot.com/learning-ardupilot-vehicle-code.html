Now that you understand the ArduPilot libraries and the way tasks work in ArduPilot it is time to start exploring a particular vehicle type. There are currently 4 vehicles in ArduPilot:
<ul>
	<li>Copter - for multicopters and helitopters</li>
	<li>Plane - for fixed wing aircraft</li>
	<li>APMrover2 - for ground vehicles and boats</li>
	<li>AntennaTracker - for antenna trackers</li>
</ul>
While there are a lot of common elements between different vehicle types, they are each different. For now we only have a detailed description of the code structure for the Copter code. You should go and read the <a href="/wiki/apmcopter-code-overview/">Copter Code Overview </a>wiki page now.

As you explore Copter you should also learn the following:
<ul>
	<li>how to <a href="/wiki/simulation-2/">run the ArduPilot SITL system</a> to simulate a vehicle and autopilot</li>
	<li>how to <a href="/wiki/debugging-with-gdb/">use gdb to debu</a><a href="https://pixhawk.org/dev/gdb_cheatsheet">g</a> your board or SITL</li>
	<li>how to <a href="/wiki/code-overview-adding-a-new-parameter/">add parameters</a> to vehicle code or libraries</li>
</ul>
