<!-- more -->

The following tests can help you determine if boot has failed, and possible causes:
<ul>
	<li>Check the Pixhawk/PX4 <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/other-project-and-common-topics/common-autopilots/common-pixhawk-overview/common-leds-pixhawk/">LEDs</a> and <a href="http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/other-project-and-common-topics/common-autopilots/common-pixhawk-overview/common-sounds-pixhawkpx4/">Sounds</a> as these can immediately confirm a successful boot. If boot fails, these can broadly indicate the point of failure. </li>
	<li>Check that the the board has appropriate ArduPilot firwmare installed.</li>
	<li>Ensure the memory card is fully inserted into the Pixhawk/controller card socket.</li>
	<li><strong>Check the boot log:</strong>
            <ol>
	      <li>Remove the SD card from from the board and insert into your regular computer</li>
	      <li>open the <strong>APM/boot.log</strong> file and check that it contains the following lines
<pre>
Starting APM sensors
Trying PX4IO board
PX4IO board OK
Starting ArduPilot
<em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel">rc.APM finished</em></em></em>
</pre>
            <ol>

</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the file does not exist or the contents are different from above then reinstall the Copter/Plane/Rover firmware.</li>
</ol>
        </li>
</ul>
