<strong>How to become a contributor</strong>: Please see <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/how-to-contribute-to-the" rel="nofollow">this post</a> for full details. Short version: we are always looking for new team members, but to avoid disrupting existing work or destabilizing code, we have processes that bring people in gradually.  In general the process is:
<ul>
	<li>Find a specific bug you'd like to fix or a specific feature you'd like to add (check out the <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues?state=open">issues list</a> if to get some ideas).</li>
	<li>Fix the bug in your own clone and test that it's working</li>
	<li>Submit the change to the main code base <a href="wiki/submitting-patches-back-to-master/">via a pull request</a>.</li>
</ul>
If this fits in well with the project's direction, you will be added to the list of developers and added to the weekly dev call.
