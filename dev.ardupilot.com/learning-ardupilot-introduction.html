This page introduces the basic structure of ArduPilot. Before you get started you should work out what code exploring system you will use. You could just use a web browser and look at <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/">https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/</a> but you will probably get a lot more out of it if you use a good programmers IDE that allows you to find function, structure and class definitions and shows the code in a structured manner.

Some suggestions are:
<ul>
	<li>Eclipse on Windows, Linux or MacOS</li>
	<li>Emacs on Linux, Windows or MacOS, with etags for finding code elements</li>
	<li>Vim on emacs with ctags</li>
</ul>
There are a lot of other IDEs available, and many of them are sufficiently customisable that they can handle something like ArduPilot nicely. If you have a favourite and have worked out how to make ArduPilot development a great experience then please consider contributing a wiki page on how to use it.
<h1>Basic structure</h1>
<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2014/12/ArduPilot_HighLevelArchecture.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6590"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6590" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2014/12/ArduPilot_HighLevelArchecture.png" alt="ArduPilot_HighLevelArchecture" width="897" height="761" /></a>

The basic structure of ArduPilot is broken up into 5 main parts:
<ul>
	<li>vehicle directories</li>
	<li>AP_HAL</li>
	<li>libraries</li>
	<li>tools directories</li>
	<li>external support code</li>
</ul>
These will be described in detail below, but before moving on make sure you have <a href="/wiki/where-to-get-the-code">cloned all of the git repositories</a> you will need.
<h2>Vehicle Directories</h2>
The vehicle directories are the top level directories that define the firmware for each vehicle type. Currently there are 4 vehicle types - Plane, Copter, APMrover2 and AntennaTracker.

Along with the *.cpp files, each vehicle directory contains a make.inc file which lists library dependencies. The Makefiles read this to create the -I and -L flags for the build.
<h2>AP_HAL</h2>
The AP_HAL layer (Hardware Abstraction Layer) is how we make ArduPilot portable to lots of different platforms. There is a top level AP_HAL in libraries/AP_HAL that defines the interface that the rest of the code has to specific board features, then there is a AP_HAL_XXX subdirectory for each board type, for example AP_HAL_AVR for AVR based boards, AP_HAL_PX4 for PX4 boards and AP_HAL_Linux for Linux based boards.
<h3>Tools directories</h3>
The tools directories are miscellaneous support directories. For examples, tools/autotest provides the autotest infrastructure behind the <a href="http://autotest.diydrones.com/">autotest.diydrones.com</a> site and tools/Replay provides our log replay utility.
<h3>External support code</h3>
On some platforms we need external support code to provide additional features or board support. Currently the external trees are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/diydrones/PX4NuttX"> PX4NuttX</a> - the core NuttX RTOS used on PX4 boards</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/diydrones/PX4Firmware">PX4Firmware</a> - the base PX4 middleware and drivers used on PX4 boards</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/diydrones/uavcan">uavcan</a> - the uavcan CANBUS implementation used in ArduPilot</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink">mavlink</a> - the mavlink protocol and code generator</li>
</ul>
[note]Most of these are imported as <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/git-submodules/">Git Submodules</a> when you build ArduPilot for PX4/Pixhawk.[/note]
<h1>Build system</h1>
The build system is based around make, but also supports the old arduino IDE for AVR builds. The makefiles are in the <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/tree/master/mk">mk/ directory</a>, and define build rules for each type of supported board

To build a vehicle or other 'sketch' for a particular board target you would type "make TARGET", where TARGET is the board type. The following board types are currently available:
<ul>
	<li>make apm1 - the APM1 board</li>
	<li>make apm2 - the APM2 board</li>
	<li>make px4-v1 - the PX4v1</li>
	<li>make px4-v2 - the Pixhawk (and <a href="http://www.auav.co/product-p/auavx2.htm" target="_blank">Arsov AUAV-X2</a>)</li>
	<li>make pxf - the BBB+PXF cape combination</li>
	<li>make navio - the RaspberryPi+NavIO cape combination</li>
	<li>make linux - a generic Linux build</li>
	<li>make flymaple - the FlyMaple board</li>
	<li>make vrbain - the VRBrain boards</li>
	<li>make sitl - the SITL software in the loop simulation</li>
</ul>
More ports are being added all the time, so check "make help" file for new targets.

For each of these builds you can add additional qualifiers, and on some you can do a parallel build to speed things up. For example, in the Copter directory you could do:
<pre>make apm2-octa -j8</pre>
meaning do a build for OctaCopter on apm2 with an 8 way parallel build. You should also look into enabling <a href="http://ccache.samba.org">ccache</a> for faster builds.

Some boards also support upload of firmware directly from make. For example:
<pre>make px4-v2-upload</pre>
will build and upload a sketch on a Pixhawk.

There are also helper make targets for specific boards, such as:
<ul>
	<li>make clean - clean the build for non-px4 targets</li>
	<li>make px4-clean - completely clean the build for PX4 targets</li>
	<li>make px4-cleandep - cleanup just dependencies for PX4 targets</li>
</ul>
