This article explains how to use <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a>/<a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo</a> simulator as the external simulator for Copter.
<!-- more -->
<h1>Overview</h1>
ROS and Gazebo are a well-known and respected robotics framework and simulator:
<ul>
	<li>The ROS framework contains many "packets" of software for performing robotics tasks. It allows you to model the environment (including indoor environments with walls, doors etc) and run your own control algorithms for autonomous flight.</li>
	<li>Gazebo supports several different Copter models (at time of writing there are 6 URDF models in the <a href="https://github.com/alexbuyval/rotors_simulator">rotors_simulator</a> package). These can be extended to include support for additional sensors and other behaviours.</li>
</ul>
[tip]The ROS/Gazebo is particularly useful for defining autonomous indoor flights.[/tip]

This article shows how you can replace the default SITL Copter simulation with one supplied by Gazebo and control the autopilot using the ROS framework (instead of <a href="copter-sitl-mavproxy-tutorial">Mavproxy</a> or some other Ground Control System).

An architectural overview of how ROS/Gazebo integrate with SITL is shown below:

<h1>Preconditions</h1>
<h2>Operating System requirements</h2>
The selected operating system must be <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation">compatible with ROS Indigo</a> in order to run all necessary ROS packets.

We recommend Ubuntu 14.04.2 as this is the platform used for testing this approach and is also known to be compatible with SITL.
<h2>ROS requirements</h2>
At time of writing only <em>ROS Indigo</em> is supported.
<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>ArduPilot installation</h2>
First download the ardupilot on your Linux machine.
<pre>git clone https://github.com/alexbuyval/ardupilot
git checkout RangeFinderSITL2
</pre>
<h2>ROS installation</h2>
Follow the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu">instructions on the ROS website</a> to install <em>ROS Indigo</em> in your machine.
<h2>Workspace creation</h2>
After installing ROS you need to create a ROS Workspace. This is the directory where custom software packages (packages which are not part of the official ROS repository) are created, copied or edited. This is also where the ROS compiler (also known as <em>catkin</em>) looks for your code.

Follow these <a class="external external_icon" title="setupcatkin" href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment#Create_a_ROS_Workspace" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">instructions to create your workspace</a>. They instruct you to create your workspace under your home folder, but it can also be created elsewhere. Just be sure you have full rights to this folder (a subfolder in your home folder is a good choice). Make sure <code>$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH</code> sees your <strong>catkin_ws/src</strong> folder.
<h2>Clone/install needed ROS packages</h2>
Execute the following commands in your console to install pre-built ROS packages:
<pre>sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-octomap-msgs</pre>
Execute the following commands in your console to clone all necessary ROS packages:
<pre>roscd
cd ../src #Navigate in your ROS user source files directory
git clone https://alexbuyval@bitbucket.org/alexbuyval/arducopter_sitl_ros.git
git clone https://github.com/PX4/mav_comm.git
git clone https://github.com/alexbuyval/rotors_simulator.git 
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/glog_catkin.git
git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple.git
cd rotors_simulator
git checkout sonar_plugin
cd ../..
wstool init src 
wstool set -t src mavros --git https://github.com/alexbuyval/mavros.git
wstool update -t src 
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y</pre>
Compile your catkin workspace. It may take some time.
<pre>cd .. #Navigate in your ROS workspace
catkin_make #Compile the files</pre>
<h2>Set up PATH to build tools</h2>
You need to set up the PATH to the build tools (located in <strong>/ardupilot/Tools/autotest</strong>) so that the build system can find <strong>sim_vehicle.sh</strong>.

Navigate the file system to the home directory and open the <strong>.bashrc</strong> file. Add the following line to the end of <strong>.bashrc</strong>:
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/ardupilot/Tools/autotest</pre>
[note]Use your own path to ardupilot folder in the line above![/note]
<h1>Start the Simulator and ROS/Gazebo</h1>
Enter the ArduCopter directory and start the SITL simulation:
<pre>cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter
sim_vehicle.sh -f arducopter_sitl_ros --console</pre>
If everything works properly you will see a <em>Gazebo</em> window similar to the one the below:

To check that all ROS nodes work properly you can run <em>rqt</em> utility with <em>Nodes Graph</em> plugin. The node graph must look like the one below:

[caption id="attachment_6011" align="alignnone" width="940"]<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/ROSNodeGraph.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6011" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/ROSNodeGraph.png" alt="ROS Node Graph" width="940" height="834" /></a> ROS Node Graph[/caption]

You can find ROS topics using the <em>Topic monitor</em> plugin in RQT (see image below):

[caption id="attachment_6012" align="alignnone" width="940"]<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/RosTopics.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6012" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/RosTopics.png" alt="ROS Topic Monitor" width="940" height="664" /></a> ROS Topic Monitor[/caption]

Some topics can be used to control the copter - e.g. <em>mavros/rc/override/</em>. Using this topic you can send a command to copter which override regular RC control. See <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/mavros">mavros wiki</a> for details.

[note]By default I run 'mavteleop' node which publishes control messages into <em>mavros/rc/override_joy/</em> (not <em>mavros/rc/override/</em>). I am using it to combine the joystick control with automatic control. So if you are going to use only a joystick control, please replace this topic on <em>mavros/rc/override/</em> in mavteleop script[/note]
<h1>Example of control node</h1>
You can try a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/alexbuyval/um_pixhawk">simple control node</a> for hovering above a visual marker. This node uses <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar">ar_track_alvar</a> node to detect and compute position of visual marker. Also this node combines control messages from joy (<strong>mavros/rc/override_joy/</strong> topic) with PD control. So you can use a joystick for altitude control or manual control when the copter doesn't see a visual marker.
<h2>Installation</h2>
Execute the following command in your console to install the marker detector package:
<pre>sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar</pre>
Execute the following command in your console to clone the control package:
<pre>roscd
cd ../src #Navigate in your ROS user source files directory
git clone https://alexbuyval@bitbucket.org/alexbuyval/um_pixhawk.git</pre>
<h2>Run the control node</h2>
Execute the following command in separate console window after you have run the SITL simulation:
<pre>roslaunch um_pixhawk hovermarker.launch</pre>
Then you should arm the copter and set <code>ALT_HOLD</code> mode using your joystick. On Saitek ST290Pro joystick you should push '4' button to set <code>ALT_HOLD</code> mode and '2' button to arm the Copter.  Then you can set a desired altitude, again using the joystick.

[note]This node assumes that you rae using a Saitek ST290Pro joystick. If you are using a different joystick you will need to copy the <strong>mavros/mavros_extras/launch/st290_joy.yaml</strong> file and change its settings as required for your joystick model.[/note]

Set the altitude to about two meters. You should then see the Copter hover above the marker as shown in the video below:
