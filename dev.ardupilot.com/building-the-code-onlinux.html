<h1>Quick start</h1>

For Ubuntu, follow these steps to build the code. For other distributions, see the advanced instructions below.

<h2>Setup</h2>

Install git:
<pre>sudo apt-get -qq -y install git</pre>

Clone the source:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot.git</pre>

Run the install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh script:
<pre>ardupilot/Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y</pre>

Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make permanent):
<pre>. ~/.profile</pre>

<h2>Build</h2>

Build for Copter:
<pre>cd ardupilot/ArduCopter
make</pre>

Build for Plane:
<pre>cd ardupilot/ArduPlane
make</pre>

Build for Rover:
<pre>cd ardupilot/APMrover2
make</pre>

Build for Antenna Tracker:
<pre>cd ardupilot/AntennaTracker
make</pre>



<h1>Advanced</h1>
To build the ardupilot firmware on Linux, you will need a cross-compiler for the type of board you are building for. If you are using a debian based distribution such as Ubuntu then the following should get you the core packages you will need:
<pre>sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avrdude avr-libc binutils-avr</pre>
You will also need some extra tools to use the SITL system and additional development tools
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-serial python-wxgtk2.8 python-matplotlib python-opencv python-pexpect python-scipy</pre>
Once installed, you can build by changing directory to the vehicle type you want to build for, and running 'make' with the target you want. Look in mk/targets.mk for a list of build targets.

<h2>Ubuntu Linux</h2>
The following packages are required to build ardupilot for the APM1/APM2 (Arduino) platform in Ubuntu: <pre>gawk make git arduino-core g++</pre>

To build ardupilot for the PX4 platform, you'll first need to install the PX4 toolchain and download the PX4 source code. See the <a href="https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/px4/dev/toolchain_installation_lin">PX4 toolchain installation page</a>.

The easiest way to install all these prerequisites is to run the <strong>ardupilot/Tools/scripts/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh</strong> script, which will
install all the required packages and download all the required
software.

<h2>Building using make</h2>

1. For Copter and AntennaTracker you'll need to run <code>make configure</code> from a sketch directory (ArduCopter or AntennaTracker) before you build the project for the first time. This will create a <strong>config.mk</strong> file at the top level of the repository. You can set some defaults in <strong>config.mk</strong>

2. In the sketch directory, type <code>make</code> to build for APM2. Alternatively, <code>make apm1</code> will build for the APM1 and `make px4` will build for the PX4. The binaries will generated in `/tmp/<i>sketchname</i>.build`.

3. Type `make upload` to upload. You may need to set the correct default serial port in your `config.mk`.
