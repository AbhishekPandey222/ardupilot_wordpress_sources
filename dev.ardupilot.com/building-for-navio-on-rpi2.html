<h1>Overview</h1>
These instructions clarify how to build ArduPilot for the NAVIO+ board on the NAVIO+'s RPi2 board itself.  These instructions assume the RPi2 has already been setup according to the manufacturer's (i.e. Emlid's) instructions <a href="http://docs.emlid.com/Navio-APM/configuring-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Alternatively you can follow Emlid's instructions on how to build from source found <a href="http://docs.emlid.com/Navio-APM/building-from-sources/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<h2>Setup</h2>
Use an ssh terminal program such as <a href="http://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">Putty</a> to log into the NAVIO+ board's RPI2.

Install the gcc-4.8 compiler using <a href="https://somewideopenspace.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/gcc-4-8-on-raspberry-pi-wheezy/" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.

[tip]When creating
<pre>/etc/apt/preferences</pre>
Type this instead:
<pre>Package: *
Pin: release n=wheezy
Pin-Priority: 900
Package: *
Pin: release n=jessie
Pin-Priority: 300
Package: *
Pin: release o=Raspbian
Pin-Priority: 200</pre>
[/tip]

Clone the source:
<pre>cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot.git</pre>
<h2>Build</h2>
Build for Copter:
<pre>cd /home/pi/ardupilot/<strong>ArduCopter</strong>
make -j4 navio</pre>
This will build the firmware for a quadcopter.  If you wish to build for another frame type (such as hexacopter) append "-hexa" onto the end of the make command (i.e. make -j4 navio-hexa).  The full list of available frames can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/mk/targets.mk#L75" target="_blank">targets.mk</a> file.

[note]If building for Plane, Rover or Antenna Tracker replace the above "ArduCopter" with "ArduPlane", "APMrover2" or "AntennaTracker".[/note]
<h2>Move firmware to the executable directory</h2>
Move the executable to the directory from where it is normally started:
<pre>sudo cp ArduCopter.elf /opt/apm/bin/<strong>ArduCopter-quad</strong></pre>
[tip]If you are unable to copy the executable it may be because the destination file is locked because it is already running.  Use the following command to kill the running executable
<pre>sudo killall ArduCopter-quad</pre>
