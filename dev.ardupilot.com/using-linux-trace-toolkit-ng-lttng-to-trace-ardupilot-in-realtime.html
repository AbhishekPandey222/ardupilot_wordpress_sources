This article explains how to use <a href="https://lttng.org">LTTng</a> for creating runtime traces for ArduPilot running on Linux boards (only).
[note]This support in the master branch (Jan 2016) but is not yet in the released vehicle branches (e.g. not in Copter 3.2, Plane 3.4 or Rover 2.5) [/note]

<h1>Overview</h1>

Tracing is a technique used to record the real-time behaviour of a software in memory and analyze the execution of the code off-line. It can be very useful to understand the interaction between threads, processes, the duration of certain events and the sequencing of some operations.

<em>LTTng</em> is a Linux tool that can be used to trace either a userspace application, or the Linux kernel itself. It produces trace files that can be analyzed later, mostly off-board. Lttng's implementation in APM uses userspace tracing but you can at the same time monitor what's going on inside the kernel, provided the kernel has tracepoints enabled (in its config).

<em>LTTng</em> has been integrated using the <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_HAL_Linux/Perf_Lttng.cpp">Perf_Lttng</a> class, which handles 3 operations: <code>Begin</code>, <code>End</code>, <code>Count</code>. You add tracing to your code by calling the performance utility methods in <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_HAL_Linux/Perf.cpp">Perf.cpp</a>.

[note]The only modules that currently include calls to the Perf API are EKF and EKF2 but it is possible to use it to monitor other modules.[/note]


<h1>Monitoring APM with LTTng</h1>

In order to monitor APM with <em>LTTng</em>, the first thing to do is to enable support for <em>LTTng</em> in ArduPilot builds. Using the regular make build system, you do this by modifying  <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/mk/board_native.mk#L30">mk/board_native.mk line 30</a>:
<pre>HAVE_LTTNG=1</pre>
Then clean and rebuild ArduPilot.

[note]You can't build statically with <em>LTTng</em> enabled because is calls dlopen. On the bebop, I had to build the whole system with armhf toolchain, which is not the one used by default[/note]


<h2>Putting trace events inside the code</h2>

In order to trace ArduPilot, you call the following performance utility methods:
<pre>hal.util-&gt;perf_begin(my_perf);</pre>
<pre>hal.util-&gt;perf_end</span>(my_perf);</pre>
Before calling these functions, <code>my_perf</code> needs to be allocated
<pre>AP_HAL::Util::perf_counter_t my_perf = hal.util-&gt;perf_alloc(AP_HAL::Util::PC_ELAPSED, "my_perf");</pre>
An example of adding multiple perf events can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/jberaud/ardupilot/commit/4bd763d58a6b529630629ad581de198f9d6e6731">this patch</a>.


<h2>Installing LTTng on your board</h2>
In order to use <em>LTTng</em>, you will have to install <em>LTTng</em> tools on your board.

The <em>LTTng</em> documentation explains how to install it on your Linux distribution <a href="https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-installing-lttng">here</a>. If there is no official package for your Linux distribution, you can also build it from the sources as explained <a href="http://lttng.org/download/#build-from-source">here</a>


<h2>Trace capture</h2>

<h3>Enable trace events in ArduPilot</h3>
Once you have the modified version of ArduPilot launched on your board and <em>LTTng</em> tools installed, you can check that ArduPilot <em>LTTng</em> events are available on your board's console terminal using the following command:
<pre class="term">lttng list --userspace</pre>
This should output a list of events including:
<pre>ardupilot:count (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)
ardupilot:end (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)
ardupilot:begin (loglevel: TRACE_DEBUG_LINE (13)) (type: tracepoint)</pre>

[tip]Refer to the <a href="https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-tracing-the-linux-kernel">LTTng documentation</a> for information on how to list kernel events.[/tip]


<h3>Capturing a trace session</h3>

A trace session can be started, stopped, re-started and destroyed.

Destroying a trace session doesn't delete the traces from permanent storage but means that you have to restart a new session if you want to continue capturing.
<ol>
	<li>Create session:
<pre>lttng create -o my_trace_directory</pre>
</li>
	<li>Enable ArduPilot events:
<pre>lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:count
lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:end
lttng enable-event --userspace ardupilot:begin</pre>
To enable kernel events, see <a href="https://lttng.org/docs/#doc-tracing-the-linux-kernel">these instructions</a>.
</li>
	<li>Start capturing:
<pre>lttng start</pre>
</li>
	<li>To stop capturing:
<pre>lttng stop</pre>
</li>
	<li>If you have <em>babeltrace</em> installed on board, you can view the result in text:
<pre>lttng view</pre>
</li>
	<li>Restart or destroy your session:
<pre>lttng destroy</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Analyzing the trace</h1>

In order to analyze your trace, first copy the trace directory you indicated at session creation to your computer.


<h2>Babeltrace</h2>

You can analyze the trace using <em>babeltrace</em>. This is a command line tool that is able to translate the trace into text format:
<pre>babeltrace my_trace_directory</pre>
The result is a series of events with the according timestamps and the number of the CPU they have been running on.

To go further with that, you can use <a href="http://diamon.org/babeltrace/docs/python/">babeltrace's python bindings</a> to write a python program analyzing the trace you have captured.


<h2>Trace compass</h2>

<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.tracecompass">Trace compass</a> is an Eclipse plugin that can read <em>LTTng</em> traces and display them in a UI that is adapted to some analyzes.

<h2>Lttng2lxt</h2>
Trace compass is very powerful but up to now, I haven't been able to analyze userspace traces in a convenient way.

<em>Lttng2lxt</em> is an open source tool written by Ivan Djelic from Parrot. It is a very simple command line tool that generate waveforms readable by <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">gtkwave</a>. I have added support for ArduPilot events to <em>lttng2lxt</em>.

In order to use it, get the sources from my github repository:
<pre>git clone https://github.com/jberaud/lttng2lxt</pre>
You will have to install <em>libbabeltrace-ctf-dev</em> and <em>libbabeltrace</em>. On Debian or Ubuntu do this with the following command:
<pre>sudo apt-get install libbabeltrace-ctf-dev libbabeltrace</pre>

Compile it:
<pre>sudo make install</pre>
Use it to generate a <em>gtkwave</em> waveform file:
<pre>lttng2lxt my_trace_directory</pre>

This will produce a file called <strong>my_trace_directory.lxt</strong>.


<h2>Analyzing your trace using gtkwave</h2>

First install <em>gtkwave</em>. On Debian or Ubuntu you can do this with the command:
<pre>sudo apt-get install gtkwave</pre>

Then open your trace using <em>gtkwave</em>:
<pre>gtkwave -A my_trace_directory.lxt</pre>
Use the <strong>Zoom fit</strong> button <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/zoom_fit.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6521"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6521" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/zoom_fit.png" alt="zoom_fit" width="1920" height="1080" /></a>.

The result should look like this:
<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/after_zoom_fit.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6522"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6522" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/after_zoom_fit.png" alt="after_zoom_fit" width="1920" height="1080" /></a>

You can then zoom in or out and see the exact execution sequence, with the associated timings
<a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/timings.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6523"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6523" src="http://dev.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/01/timings.png" alt="timings" width="1920" height="1080" /></a>

You can therefore measure the duration of an event with the cursors (use the mouse middle button to set the first cursor)
