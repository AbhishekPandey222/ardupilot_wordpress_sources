<h1>Real time voice chat on Mumble</h1>
The ArduPilot dev team uses a mumble server for real-time voice chat.

[note]The channel is for development discussions only. Please don't use it as a user help channel.[/note]

You can join the chat at any time:
<ul>
	<li>server: mumble.dronecode.org</li>
	<li>port: 10028</li>
	<li>software: <a href="http://mumble.sf.net">http://mumble.sf.net</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>Please note that the port number is NOT the default mumble port number. If you find an empty server then please check your port number</strong>
<h2>Usernames</h2>
When you first join the server it will ask you to choose a username. Please choose something like <em>FirstnameLastname</em>. The user name must not have any spaces.
<h2>Weekly dev calls</h2>
We have a weekly development call at 00:00 UTC on Mondays. See the drones-discuss mailing list for agenda and minutes. The call is held in the "Weekly Dev Call" channel on mumble.

We don't record the calls, and we would ask you not to record them yourself. Minutes will be posted to the drones-discuss list after the meeting.

In the audio configuration section please select Push to Talk and use a headset to reduce noise on the call.
<h2>General Chat</h2>
We have a "General Discussion" channel for chatting about ArduPilot development at any time. How many developers are connected depends a lot on timezones.
