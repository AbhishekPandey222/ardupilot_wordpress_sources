This page describes how we use <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodules</a> in the ArduPilot build. Submodules are used to manage external dependencies in the ArduPilot build, particularly for building for PX4 targets.

<h1>Background</h1>

<em>Git submodules</em> allow us to automatically bring in dependent git trees in the ArduPilot build. It replaces our old mechanism of having to separately clone the <strong>diydrones/PX4Firmware</strong> and <strong>diydrones/PX4NuttX</strong> tree when developers want to build for PX4 targets.

[note]For now <em>git submodules</em> are only used for the PX4 builds. It is likely we will start to use submodules for other builds in the future (for example, we will probably use them for the mavlink message XML files)[/note]

See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules</a> for more information on <em>git submodules</em>.


<h1>Submodule approach</h1>
The approach we have implemented in ArduPilot is to use a single level of <em>git submodules</em>, with all modules stored in the <strong>modules/</strong> directory. This approach was chosen as it makes for diagnosis of issues with submodules somewhat simpler.

This means that the submodules from the upstream PX4Firmware tree are not used. Instead each required submodule is added as a direct submodule of the ArduPilot tree.

You may also note that the URLs used for the submodules use the old <code>git://</code> protocol. This was done to make it less likely we will get accidental commits on the master repositories while developers are getting used to <em>git submodules</em> (as the <code>git://</code> protocol is read-only). Developers with commit access to the submodules should add a new diydrones remote with a writeable protocol as needed.



<h1>Common errors</h1>
The following is a list of comment errors and how to deal with them.


<h2>Errors with config.mk</h2>

If you have an existing config.mk you may get an error like this:
<pre>../mk/px4_targets.mk:8: *** NUTTX_SRC found in config.mk - Please see http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/git-submodules/. Stop.</pre>

That happens because you have previously built with an external PX4Firmware and PX4NuttX tree, and you need to convert to using submodules. The simplest way to fix this is to remove your <strong>config.mk</strong> file as it is no longer needed. If you want to keep the file for some reason then you can either comment out or removed the lines in <strong>config.mk</strong> which specify the <code>PX4_ROOT</code>, <code>NUTTX_SRC</code> and <code>UAVCAN_DIR</code> variables.


<h2>Errors from old PX4Firmware and PX4NuttX trees</h2>

You may get warnings like these in your build:
<pre>../mk/px4_targets.mk:23: *** You have an old PX4Firmware tree - see http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/git-submodules/
../mk/px4_targets.mk:26: *** You have an old PX4NuttX tree - see http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/git-submodules/
../mk/px4_targets.mk:29: *** You have an old uavcan tree - see http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/git-submodules/</pre>
This indicates that you have old PX4Firmware or PX4NuttX directories in ../PX4Firmware or ../PX4NuttX. The warning is harmless and won't prevent you from building. The warning is there so you know that commits and changes made in those directories won't be used.


<h2>Updating submodules</h2>

If you need to manually update submodules you should run the command
<pre>git submodule update</pre>
from the root of the ardupilot tree. That will check all submodules for updates in the diydrones repository and will pull in changes as needed.


<h2>Disaster recovery</h2>

If things have gone very badly wrong with your git tree the simplest thing to do it to remove the modules/ directory completely. Then do a new px4 build with
<pre>make px4-v2</pre>
and the submodules will be automatically reinitialised and updated.
