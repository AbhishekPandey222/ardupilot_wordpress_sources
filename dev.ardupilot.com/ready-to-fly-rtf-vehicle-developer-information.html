This section is for developer information related to "non-standard" RTF vehicles based on ArduPilot. 

[note]ArduPilot-based UAVs are often very similar from a developer perspective; developers upload standard firmware direct to the flight controller using Mission Planner (or other GCS software). This section is for vehicles that use a non-standard approach, including modified source, different approaches for uploading firmware, support for companion computers, etc. [/note]
