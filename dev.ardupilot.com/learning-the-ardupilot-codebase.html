<h1>Introduction</h1>
The ArduPilot code base is quite large (about 700k lines for the core ardupilot git tree) and can be quite intimidating to a new user. This page is meant to give some suggestions on how to come up to speed on the code quickly. It assumes you already are familiar with the key concepts of C++ and the many of the examples currently assume you will be exploring the code on a Linux system.

This page and the pages linked below are designed to be used as a tutorial. You should work through each page step by step, trying things for yourself as you go. We will also be adding more pages over time. If you think some important information is missing or could be improved then please <a href="https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues">open an issue</a> on the ArduPilot github and we'll try to get to it when we can.

<h1>Welcome to ArduPilot!</h1>
If you have gotten this far you should be in a good position to start getting involved with ArduPilot development. Please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/drones-discuss">join the drones-discuss mailing list</a> and join in on the discussions. We also have a weekly mumble developer conference call, some Skype chat channels and some IRC channels. Ask any ardupilot developer for details.

Welcome to ArduPilot development, we hope you enjoy being part of our community!
