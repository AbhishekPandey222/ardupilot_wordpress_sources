Copter 3.2 adds a DCM heading check and an <a href="wiki/common-apm-navigation-extended-kalman-filter-overview/">EKF (Extended Kalman Filter - Pixhawk only)</a> check to catch flyaways caused by a bad heading estimate.

<h3>When will it trigger?</h3>
The DCM check runs by default on all boards and will trigger when the GPS implied heading and DCM's estimated heading disagree by at least 60 degrees (configurable with the DCM_CHECK_THRESH parameter) for a full second.

The EKF check runs only on the Pixhawk and only when the EKF is being used as the primary source for attitude and position estimates (i.e. AHRS_EKF_USE = 1).  This check will trigger when the EKF's compass and velocity "variance" are higher than 0.8 (configurable with EKF_CHECK_THRESH parameter) for one second.  This "variance" increases as the estimates become untrustworthy.  0 = very trustworthy, &gt;1.0 = very untrustworthy.  If both variances climb above the EKF_CHECK_THRESH parameter (default is 0.8) the EKF/Inav failsafe triggers.
<h3>What will happen when the failsafe triggers?</h3>
The Pixhawk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-CMLrAwlco&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=60" target="_blank">LED will flash red-yellow, the tone-alarm will sound</a>.
If telemetry is attached "EKF variance" will appear on the HUD.
And EKF/DCM error will be written to the dataflash logs

If flying in a flight mode that does not require GPS nothing further will happen but you will be unable to switch into an autopilot flight mode (Loiter, PosHold, RTL, Guided, Auto) until the failure clears.

If flying in a mode that requires GPS (Loiter, PosHold, RTL, Guided, Auto) the vehicle will switch to "pilot controlled" LAND.  Meaning the pilot will have control of the roll and pitch angle but the vehicle will descend, land and finally disarm it's motors.  The pilot can, like always switch into a manual flight mode including Stabilize or AltHold to bring the vehicle home.
<h3>Adjusting sensitivity or disabling the check</h3>
The DCM and EKF check and failsafe can be disabled by setting the DCM_CHECK_THRESH or EKF_CHECK_THRESH to "0" through the Mission Planner's Config/Tuning &gt;&gt; Full Parameter List.  Alternatively it can be made less sensitive by increasing this parameter from 0.8 to 0.9 or 1.0.  The downside of increasing this parameter's value is that during a flyaway caused by a bad compass or GPS glitching, the vehicle will fly further away before the vehicle is automatically switched to LAND mode.
