The easiest way to load the latest code is by using the Mission Planner much like you would for a <a href="AC2_Loading.html">quad </a> . You can download the latest Mission Planner <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/downloads/list">here </a>. The only difference being that after you click on the "Firmware" button, you click on the helicopter icon.

Alternatively you may download the source code from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/source/browse/#git%2FArduCopter">google code </a> using a tool such as Tortoise git, load the code into Arduino IDE and press the Upload button as described in these <a href="Quad_LoadingPage.html">slightly out-of-date instructions </a> but this is for advanced users who want to customise the code in some way.
