One of the first steps in using Copter is to decide on the frame.  Shown above are three options from <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/" target="_blank">3DRobotics</a> but there are hundreds of other choices.  This page will hopefully give some guidance on the choices available.

<h3>Decide what you want it for</h3>
Some common uses of multi-copters include:
<ul>
	<li>Taking <a href="wiki/common-cameras-and-gimbals/" target="_blank">aerial videos</a></li>
	<li><a href="wiki/common-fpv-first-person-view/" target="_blank">FPV (first person view)</a></li>
	<li>Sport &amp; Social (racing, aerobatics, impressing your friends)</li>
	<li>More professional uses such as <a href="wiki/common-3d-mapping/" target="_blank">3D mapping</a>, package delivery, agriculture</li>
	<li>For research or personal robotics <a href="http://dev.ardupilot.com/" target="_blank">development</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ready-To-Fly, Kits or Build your Own</h3>
The choice of Ready-to-fly (RTF) vs Build-your-Own mostly comes down to how much time you are happy to spend building up your copter and how personalised you wish it to be.  With the growing number of low-cost RTF copters on the market, there is likely little cost advantage to building your own, especially for the smaller copters and if you factor in some missteps along the way (like buying the wrong parts).

<a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/t/diy-kits/arducopter" target="_blank">Complete Kits like these from 3DR</a> are an intermediate step.  They ensure you have all the parts you need, the final result will be very close to the RTF but they are slightly cheaper because you perform the frame assembly and flight controller configuration yourself.
