The recommended method for mounting your APM/Pixhawk is to build an extra layer for the APM/Pixhawk between the main body and the landing gear as show in the image below.

<ul>
	<li>Separate the helicopter's main body from it's landing gear</li>
	<li>Attach one carbon fibre plate to the body, the other to the landing gear</li>
	<li>Drill holes in the upper and lower mounting plates so that the plates can be attached with four strong 3cm or 4cm stand-offs</li>
	<li>Mount the APM/Pixhawk to the bottom mounting plate using vibration dampening foam (see <a href="common-vibration-damping">Vibration Dampening wiki page</a> for ideas on mounting methods to isolate the flight controller from vibrations)</li>
</ul>
