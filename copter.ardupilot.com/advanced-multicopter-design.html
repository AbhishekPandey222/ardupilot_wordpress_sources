<h3>There are several popular frame layouts for MultiCopters</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Tricopter uses 3 motor / propeller propulsion units with a servo to rotate one of them to compensate for adverse yaw.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Tricopters were popular early on when the brushless motor / propeller units were new and scarce.</li>
	<li>They suffer from less than stellar performance and do not scale well to larger sizes.</li>
	<li>But they still have some popularity for small, light hobby use applications.</li>
	<li>Because this is primarily an outdated design we will not expand further on it in this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11460" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3-300x225.jpg" alt="$_3" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<ul style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">
	<li><strong>The very popular Quadcopter has 4 motor/propeller units and is available in any size.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A Quadcopter is an elegantly simple design and is hands down the most popular layout for a whole lot of reasons.</li>
	<li>Quadcopters are symmetrical and embody the simplest principle of operation for controlling roll, pitch, yaw and motion.</li>
	<li>Simply varying the speed of each of the motors provides full 3D motion and rotation and hover capability.</li>
	<li>They are relatively inexpensive to produce and they scale well to production manufacturing techniques.</li>
	<li>In various sizes and layouts they are capable of actually performing useful tasks beyond simply flying around.</li>
	<li>Their primary drawback is that a single motor failure generally results in an abrupt descent to the ground (crash).</li>
	<li>A very wide variety of materials and techniques can be employed to produce a useful Quadcopter.</li>
	<li>There are several popular configurations for QuadCopters:
<ul>
	<li>X with and X frame arm layout and the front and back of the copter between 2 propellers.</li>
	<li>+ with with the same kind of X frame layout as above but with the front and back of the copter in line with one of the propellers.</li>
	<li>"Dead Cat" a variation on X which in which the frame arms are further apart in the front and the back than they are side to side.
<ul>
	<li>Name actually comes from Bart Jansen a Dutch artist who stuffed his expired cat and made a Quadcopter out of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>H which has frame side arms running between the motors on each side and connected with one or more frame arms in the middle.</li>
	<li>Square which has frame arms connecting between motors (and usually intermediate frame arms supporting a central frame.)</li>
	<li>And variations including ones with the motors laid out on a circle.</li>
	<li>Most of them primarily operate the same as the X frame (provides better camera exposure between motors among other things).</li>
	<li>I recommend the standard X frame design because it is strong and simple and it's natural symmetry balances flying forces better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>A humming bird sized<strong> <a href="http://www.estesrockets.com/helis-quads/quadcopters/004606-proto-x">Estes Proto X</a></strong> is shown below.</li>

<ul>
	<li><strong>For professional use, HexaCopters and OctoCopters with 6 and 8 Motor/propeller propulsion units are popular.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Hexacopters, Octocopters, Hex Y's and Octo X's can provide stable heavy lift platforms good for photography and other uses.</li>
	<li>Hex and Octocopters may have the benefit of potentially being able to continue to fly with a single motor failure.</li>
	<li>However the increased complexity versus a Quadcopter makes them more failure prone.</li>
	<li>The reduction in prop size and increase in prop speed result in a smoother flight than an equivalent large blade Quadcopter.</li>
	<li>However it also results in some reduction in flight efficiency and endurance all other things being equal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/hexacopter.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11467" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/hexacopter.jpg" alt="hexacopter" width="600" height="397" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hex Y6 and Octo X8 designs with pairs of coaxial motor/propeller units mounted back to back are also becoming popular.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The coaxial push pull motor/prop units of the <strong><a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/diy-y6-kit">Hex Y</a></strong> and Octo X provide the most lift in the smallest area but at the cost of efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/pic_prod_y6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11468" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/pic_prod_y6.jpg" alt="pic_prod_y6" width="800" height="364" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>These Y Hex and <strong><a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/x8-plus">X Octo</a></strong> designs are simple and compact with good lifting capability and single motor failure tolerance.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/pic_prod_x8.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11469" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/pic_prod_x8.jpg" alt="pic_prod_x8" width="800" height="364" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Singlecopters and Coax copters are very new designs and have some advantages in specific applications.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Since they tend to a single ducted body for either the one or two motor/propeller units they tend to be self protected indoors.</li>
	<li>The coax copter which relies on variable thrust on each of it's 2 props for rotation is functionally simpler than the single copter.</li>
	<li>The side profile of the ducted body makes these copters more susceptible to winds outdoors requiring more effort to compensate.</li>
	<li>While generally good at hovering and fine positioning, they are more speed and performance limited than other multicopter designs.</li>
	<li>The Singlecopter in particular is reasonably adaptable to gasoline engines for much greater endurance.</li>
	<li>The possibility of using a single large propeller implies that good efficiencies could be realized even with an electric versions.</li>
	<li>The Singlecopter features a single motor/propeller unit with 4 servo controlled vanes to direct roll, pitch and yaw.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/vtolcustom2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11471" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/vtolcustom2.jpg" alt="vtolcustom2" width="750" height="419" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Coaxcopter has dual motor/propeller units for thrust and yaw control and 2 servo controlled vanes for roll and  pitch.</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/mav_electric.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11472" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/mav_electric.jpg" alt="mav_electric" width="240" height="185" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>There are also variable pitch Multicopters for incredible acrobatic performance.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Variable pitch multicopters have some interesting potential uses as well like the <strong><a href="http://curtisyoungblood.com/V2/content/stingray-500">Curtis Youngblood Stingray 500</a></strong> shown below.</li>
	<li>Servo control of the props (rotors) produces roll, pitch and yaw so they are often powered by a single motor with shaft or belt drive.</li>
	<li>If you use a single motor it is feasible to use a gasoline engine giving you the potential for considerable endurance and range.</li>
	<li>These are very high performance and can even fly inverted, they are also mechanically more complex but can be built robustly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>And copters with more than 8 motor/propeller units may be useful for specialized, extreme <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L75ESD9PBOw">(or insane)</a> applications.</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/evolo2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11473" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/evolo2.png" alt="evolo2" width="300" height="196" /></a>



<h3>Motors, propellers and ESCs</h3>
<strong>For multicopters, motors, propellers and ESCs (speed controllers) are critical and have been failure prone in the past.</strong>
This ECalc based <strong><a href="http://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php?ecalc&amp;lang=en">Xcopter: motor - propeller - battery - ESC calculator</a></strong> will help you pick the best components for your copter.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quadcopter design will be used for illustration as they are the most wide spread and the most versatile.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>But the information applies equally to Hex and Octo designs, either conventional or coaxial Y and X types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>The brushless out-runner motors have to support the full weight of the copter continuously while turning at high speed.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Hobby grade motors have often used inadequate Conrad type unsealed bearings which are good axially but not in thrust.
<ul>
	<li>And the motors are usually open frame to permit the greatest cooling but providing little or no protection</li>
	<li>This has meant an unnecessarily high failure rate and very poor survival in wet or dusty conditions.</li>
	<li>The cheapest possible Chinese motor is never a good choice for something that literally hangs in the air by it's motor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Some of the best motors have 2 or better 3 easily replaceable ABEC-7 bearings, RCTiger-Motor Pro series and KDE for instance.
<ul>
	<li>The best motors are well ventilated, made with high temperature components and coated and sealed for environmental protection.</li>
	<li>The best motors like TMotor and KDE have performance comparison charts, these should be reviewed when designing a copter</li>
	<li>You are best off selecting motor - prop - battery cell combinations that will provide 10% or higher G/W efficiency at 50% throttle.</li>
	<li>You should also target you copter design weight so that it hovers at approximately 50% throttle for optimum efficiency and flight time.</li>
	<li>Top motors can cost considerably more, but reliability, performance and efficiency can be much better and worth it in the long run.</li>
	<li>Low KV motors running on lower voltage (fewer cells) with large propellers are the most efficient and provide the longest flight times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Selecting the best motor, propeller, battery set will enable you to build a copter with a usable 30 minute flight time including a camera.
<ul>
	<li>You can get 30 minutes from 330 copters with 8" props to 700 size copters with 18" props depending on camera / gimbal weight.</li>
	<li>It is very hard to get much more than 30 minutes of usable flight time from any "useful" multicopter regardless of size.</li>
	<li>For hobby grade components, 20 minute maximum flight times would be a more realistic goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>ESCs are also very important.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>High quality ESCs are more reliable than cheap ones.</li>
	<li>And ESCs need to be properly sized to ensure they can provide the maximum current that is necessary.
<ul>
	<li>Generally use the right size not over sized because they are more efficient if operated in the appropriate range (and lighter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Sufficient cooling is also very important especially for "Heavy Lift" copters, and the ESCs may need to be placed in the air stream.</li>
	<li>For small to medium QuadCopters there are four in one ESCs in the 20 - 30 Amp size range with several advantages.
<ul>
	<li>They eliminate the need for a power distribution plate or block and all the attendant wiring.</li>
	<li>The considerable reduction in DC wiring results in less magnetometer (compass) interfering DC EMF radiation.</li>
	<li>They can often be conveniently installed tidily in the center of the copter frame.</li>
	<li>The 20 and 25 amp ones work with 3 or 4 cell LiPo batteries and the 30 amp one works with 3 to 6 cell batteries.</li>
	<li>They have a built in aluminum heat sink plate on one side (which you can augment with a finned heat sink if necessary).</li>
	<li>You can use a thin layer of Fujik silicone thermal glue to attach a finned heat sink if one is needed.</li>
	<li>They generally have higher reliability than individual ESCs and are reasonably priced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Larger diameter slower turning propellers are normally a lot more efficient than smaller, faster ones.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>But there are limits and drawbacks:
<ul>
	<li>Trying to turn too large a prop for a given motor can cause it to overheat so motors usually have a maximum prop size.</li>
	<li>Also, really large, slow props can reduce the responsiveness of the multicopter and even cause it to oscillate in the air or vibrate.</li>
	<li>Unless taken to extremes these difficulties are not usually significant and can be compensated for by various means.</li>
	<li>And you can always drop the diameter an inch if the handling characteristics or motor stress are not what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>There are also different designs of propellers and for larger ones turning at slower speeds design is especially critical.
<ul>
	<li>Carbon fiber designs with cupped blades that are wider at the hub and narrower at the tip are best for larger sizes 14" and over.</li>
	<li>Smaller ones in the 14" and under category can be of more conventional design with a wider than normal blade and of plastic or CF.</li>
	<li>Often motors are "charted" with specific propellers and these are certainly the best starting point for optimum performance.</li>
	<li>TMotor is considered a premium prop, but good results have been obtained with RC-Timer and Tarot in the large tapered props.</li>
	<li>APC, DJI, GemFan, RC Drones and Graupner all produce good props in the 14" and under category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Professional Grade Power System for large Quadcopters (28" Propellers)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The <a href="http://www.rctigermotor.com/html/2013/Efficiency-Type_1219/176.html">Tigermotor U8 Pro</a> Series motor is currently top of the line for a commercially available (large) copter motor.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It features Environmentally protected, closed construction and easily replaceable bearings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/TmotorU8Pro1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11488" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/TmotorU8Pro1.png" alt="TmotorU8Pro" width="344" height="280" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>They have very high quality two piece 27, 28 and 29" carbon fiber propellers for them as well</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/TMotor29Prop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11490" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/TMotor29Prop.jpg" alt="TMotor29Prop" width="689" height="236" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>And a top quality 70 AMP ESC (speed controller) to go with it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/thumb_345_220_20131219042814912.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11491" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/thumb_345_220_20131219042814912.jpg" alt="thumb_345_220_20131219042814912" width="341" height="220" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>U8 Pro T-Motor $300.00, 28" CF Props $370.00 a pair, 70 Amp Pro ESC $110.00 @ four each = $2380.00.</li>
	<li>These are used in the large Steadidrone Quadcopter shown above, clearly a top quality professional and expensive product.</li>
	<li>This is a very heavy lift and long endurance copter and is completely excessive and hazardous for most uses and needs.</li>
	<li>This combination will work well for a Quadcopter with a total weight of up to 24 pounds and can achieve 40 minute flight times.</li>
	<li>This is a copter designed for very serious uses that demand it's heavy lift and long endurance capabilities and is not for amateurs.</li>
	<li>Disaster relief, search and rescue, fire spotting, surveillance, ecological and geographical survey and mapping are appropriate uses.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h4>Professional Grade Power System for Medium Quadcopters (16" Propellers)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Clearly, applying similar quality to a more reasonably sized (and cost) copter is normally going to be a lot more practical.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A <strong><a href="http://www.rctigermotor.com/html/2013/Professional_0912/52.html">380KV T-Motor 4008</a></strong> is $85.00, 16x5 CF Prop $90.00 a pair and 30 Amp Pro ESC $50.00 @ four each = $720.00.</li>
	<li>This setup will work well for a copter up to 10 pounds or so and provide exceptional durability, efficiency and endurance.</li>
	<li>This is a very practical setup for a professional Quadcopter for photo or video use with full sized cameras and a brushless gimbal.</li>
	<li>It can be set up to let you choose 4S 14.8 volt, 5S 18.8 volt or 6S 22.2 volt batteries and 14" to 17" props according to your total weight.</li>
	<li>With a proper setup you could reasonably expect to achieve practical 30 minute plus flight times with full camera equipment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">This is a very superior ($120.00) <a href="http://www.kdedirect.com/KDE4014XF380.html">KDE 4014XF-380KV Motor</a> with 3 large replaceable ABEC bearings rated at about 200 hours.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This motor is capable of using 13" to 18" propellers and operating very efficiently with a wide range of batteries from 3 cell to 6 cell.</li>
	<li>This KDE Motor has a phenomenal range of operation and can be used on a 7 pound to a 20 pound Quadcopter.</li>
	<li>Every component and manufacturing technique was clearly optimized to produce the best possible motor without compromise.</li>
	<li>This motor has a finned heat-sink case and a self ventilated design with high temperature encapsulated components.</li>
	<li>In fact it is designed to run, if necessary, continuously at temperatures that would instantly destroy most other motors.</li>
	<li>It is reasonable to expect that various configurations could provide well over an hour of useful operating time with cameras.</li>
	<li>It is feasible to produce a QuadCopter that will approach the performance of the $15,000.00 Steadidrone at a fraction of the cost.</li>
	<li>A similar practical lifting capability and nearly 40 minute useful flight times should be achievable even with 18" Propellers.</li>
	<li>And given the extreme over design and ruggedness of the motors, similar reliability and longevity could also be expected.</li>
	<li>This is the motor I will be using in my next Quadcopter and I will allow for up to 18" propellers.</li>

	<li>This is the only motor in this size that can get G/W efficiencies over 17 at 50 percent throttle.</li>
	<li>If you want to build a 4-8 pound copter for maximum endurance this is the motor to use with a 4 cell LiPo.</li>
	<li>Because of it's extremely high efficiency in it's hover range it is also a candidate for high efficiency lithium batteries.</li>
	<li>Panasonic or LG's high power Lithium batteries have about twice the energy density of the LiPos we normally use.</li>
	<li>But maximum discharge is only 2C so low current draw is required, the high efficiency of these motors can provide that.</li>
	<li>Carbon fiber 14" to 16" propellers will be required.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Professional Grade Power System for Small Quadcopters (10" - 14" Propellers)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The largest market segment is for Quadcopters in frame sizes that use 10 to 14 inch propellers and weigh 3 to 7 pounds.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong><a href="http://www.rctigermotor.com/html/2013/Professional_0912/49.html">650 KV T-Motor MT3506</a></strong> at $65.00 is a high quality small but powerful pancake that can turn props from 11" to 14" diameter.</li>
	<li>With a 3 cell LiPo battery and T-Motor 14" prop at $73.00 a pair it can lift up to 7 pounds and achieve very good endurance.</li>
	<li>Add 4 T-Motor 18 Amp ESCs at $27.00 @ four each = $514.00 for top quality motors, props and ESCs.</li>
	<li>This small pancake motor can achieve good efficiency with 3S 11.1 volt or 4S 14.8 volt LiPo batteries and an appropriate sized prop.</li>
	<li>The frame should be sized to accept up to 14" propellers and various battery configurations.</li>
	<li>It should be configurable to achieve 20+ minute flight times with a GoPro size camera and brushless gimbal plus FPV or telemetry.</li>
	<li>This would still be a very capable and rugged Quadcopter capable of professional results and reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The above Motor / Propeller / ESC setups are all as close to professional quality as we can currently make them.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h4>Consumer Grade Power System for Medium Quadcopters (15" - 16" Propellers)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>It is also possible to build a reasonably reliable and efficient Quadcopter using less expensive components.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The $45.00 <strong><a href="http://www.himodel.com/electric/SUNNYSKY_X4112S_400KV_Outrunner_Brushless_Motor_for_Multi-rotor_Aircraft.html">SunnySky 390KV X4112S</a></strong> motor or the really low cost $18.00 <strong><a href="http://rctimer.com/product-575.html">RCTimer 5010-14</a></strong> 360KV motors.</li>
	<li>Which will work well with an easy to install and low EMF $40.00 <strong><a>Hobbywing four in one ESC</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/9201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11517" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/9201-252x300.jpg" alt="9201" width="252" height="300" /></a><a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/575.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11522" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/575-300x244.jpg" alt="575" width="300" height="244" /></a><a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3281_dimg2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11500" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3281_dimg2-300x171.jpg" alt="3281_dimg2" width="300" height="171" /></a>
<ul>
	<li> And they both work well with RCTimer 15x5.5" (4 for $28.00) or 16x5.5" (4 for $35.00) CF propellers.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/7471.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11520" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/7471-300x300.jpg" alt="747" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11523" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/841-300x260.jpg" alt="841" width="300" height="260" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Sunnysky Combo will cost about $260.00 and work very efficiently for copters up to about ten pounds.</li>
	<li>The RCTimer Combo will cost about $150.00 and will provide extended flight time for copters up to about 6 pounds.</li>
	<li>These motors will both actually support up to 17" propellers and work with 3 to 6 cell LiPo batteries.</li>
	<li>You could still design a copter that would get 30 minute flight times while carrying a GoPro and gimbal if desired.</li>
	<li>The frame for either of these motors should be designed to support at least 16" prop diameter and 17" would be better.</li>
	<li>These will not last as long nor be as reliable as the previous T-Motor configurations but will still deliver lots of solid use.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h4>Consumer Grade Power System for Small Quadcopters (8" - 12" Propellers)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Here is a durable and low cost alternative for powering smaller hobby or even semi-pro sub 5 pound Quadcopters.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/231128616387?lpid=82">DJI 2212 Motors</a></strong> provided with their low cost ARF Flamewheel Quadcopters are unusually durable and cost $24.00 each.</li>
	<li>And DJI's specially hubbed 10" plastic props at $8.00 a pair are well balanced, efficient and rugged.<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/dji-motor01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11498" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/dji-motor01-300x300.jpg" alt="dji-motor01" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/DJI-PROP-1038-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11499" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/DJI-PROP-1038-2-300x114.jpg" alt="DJI-PROP-1038-2" width="300" height="114" /></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>And this easy to use $40.00 four in one ESC eliminates a power distribution board, reduces EMF and provides good reliability.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3281_dimg2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11500" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/3281_dimg2-300x171.jpg" alt="3281_dimg2" width="300" height="171" /></a>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li> For $150.00 you can actually get quite a useful and durable power system for a smaller sub five pound quadcopter.</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>The $40.00 SunnySky X4108S pancake motor is also capable of being used on Quadcopters lifting up to 10 pounds.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It is well regarded, efficient and durable and is suitable for use with 14" or 15" propellers and 4 cell to 6 cell LiPo batteries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/yhst-90268561309754_2272_89762591.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11629" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/yhst-90268561309754_2272_89762591.jpg" alt="yhst-90268561309754_2272_89762591" width="500" height="300" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Clearly these are not the only alternatives.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to use your copter for constant, professional use you will want something like the first 3 configurations.</li>
	<li>For occasional, hobby or non-critical use for flying, FPV and / or personal video or photography the others should be OK.</li>
	<li>The KDE and Pro T-Motors bearings will last longer and are more weather proof and reliable than the less expensive alternatives.</li>
	<li>And the more expensive Carbon Fiber props are more efficient, better balanced and more durable than cheaper alternatives.</li>
	<li>But properly installed on an appropriate copter the less expensive alternatives listed can provide many reliable hours of flying.</li>
	<li>I have favored slow speed pancake motors because efficiency and flight time benefit from the larger propellers they can use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>The above illustrates just some of the possibilities in identifying an appropriate power system for your project.</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3>The MultiCopter Frame</h3>
<strong>There are many types of frames and it is most important to put together a frame that is appropriate for your use.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>There are a lot of Multicopter frame types and many are available as bare frame kits or Almost Ready To Fly or Ready To Fly copters.
<ul>
	<li>Most professional grade Multicopters are made from fiberglass and carbon fiber cut tubing and plate.
<ul>
	<li>Carbon fiber is very strong, but is also brittle and can shatter on impact, it is also hard to machine and to glue to.</li>
	<li>Fiberglass weighs a bit more for equivalent strength but is more shatter resistant and easier to machine and glue to.</li>
	<li>Fiberglass or carbon fiber tube and sheet construction are very suitable to use for making your own copters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Many consumer grade Multicopters are made with injection molded plastic parts and aluminum tubing.
<ul>
	<li>Some injection molded parts can be very durable (the Iris's Zytel frame arms for instance), but others are cheap and break easily.</li>
	<li>Square aluminum tubing frame arms are common, but they tend to bend or break with annoying frequency in normal mishaps.</li>
	<li>Except in specialized welded H or box frames aluminum tubing frame arms are sub optimal and will not be covered in depth here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Some of the newer, smaller, commercially made Quadcopters have monolithic injection molded plastic shells.
<ul>
	<li>On smaller copters these shells can be quite durable but they would be too fragile on larger ones even if mold costs were justified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>A few Quadcopters have monolithic shells made from vacuum formed laminated Kydex or other plastic sheet
<ul>
	<li>Vacuum formed shells of laminated Kydex have proven very durable on small copters and are very good for waterproof uses.</li>
	<li>At least one vacuum formed copter has been made with built in blade guards the Safe Flight 4410 (unfortunately out of business).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li> Hand laid fiberglass or carbon fiber is also popular on high end quadcopters.
<ul>
	<li>There are some very attractive, hard to get and not inexpensive hand laid fiberglass and carbon fiber shells made by "DeX".</li>
	<li>There are also a variety of fiberglass shells for civilian, commercial and military use including an amphibious one.</li>
	<li>Fiberglass shells tend to be expensive and may get damaged in use and can be difficult to repair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Each type of construction has advantages and disadvantages and it is very important to figure out what is important for your needs.</li>
	<li>Prop to prop and prop to frame clearance limit the max diameter of your propeller blades.
<ul>
	<li>Allowing for various prop diameters will let you tune the copter for its current weight, batteries and function..</li>
	<li>Generally allow an additional half inch of clearance from prop tip to tip or to center frame to avoid asymmetrical prop wash vibration.</li>
	<li>A major design criteria is to size the frame appropriately for the largest propellers you might ever want to use.</li>
	<li>Generally bigger propeller diameter equals better efficiency and an X frame layout normally permits the largest possible props.</li>
	<li>Of course the motor speed and power and frame strength have to be matched to the propeller diameter and to total lifting capacity.</li>
	<li>Pancake Low KV, Low RPM motors can turn bigger propellers efficiently.</li>
	<li>It is possible to overlap prop tips if you have one above the other, but it does affect efficiency and induces asymmetric vibration.</li>
	<li>Big slow props can have adverse vibration, instability, gust compensation and response rate issues also so that is a downside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The additional motors of Hex and Octocopters can permit single motor out recovery and provide for smoother flight for photo uses.
<ul>
	<li>But they need to use smaller propellers because of motor to motor clearance which is less efficient resulting in shorter flight times.</li>
	<li>There is also additional cost and weight of the frames and extra motors and propellers.</li>
	<li>And, the overall increase in complexity also reduces reliability.</li>
	<li>High quality extended service larger pancake motors and props are just starting to become available.</li>
	<li>So we are likely to see a shift to large Quadcopters from Hexacopters and Octocopters even for professional and commercial uses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>The Carbon Fiber or Fiberglass Tube and Plate Frame</h4>
<strong>The carbon fiber or fiberglass tube and plate frame is popular because it is strong and light and easily manufactured.</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The <a href="http://www.helipal.com/tarot-fy650-quadricopter-frame-set.html">Tarot 650</a> is a typical layout medium sized carbon fiber Quadcopter frame that can work with up to 17" propellers.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It features folding arms and landing gear.</li>
	<li>It's ability to support pancake motors and 17" props means it can provide long flight times.</li>
	<li>Some people have said the quality of construction is not as good as it could be but for $125.00 it is an amazing bargain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/T2eC16hwFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ60_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11528" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/T2eC16hwFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ60_3.jpg" alt="$T2eC16h,!)wFIZrQuFnzBSVOZPjKoQ~~60_3" width="602" height="419" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fabrication requirements and techniques for fiberglass and carbon fiber tube and plate copters.</strong></li>
	<li>On the copters shown above the method of attachment is by clamping carbon fiber tube frame arms with aluminum brackets.
<ul>
	<li>This is because of the difficulties in attaching carbon fiber parts as well as the stress that can result from drilling the tubing.</li>
	<li>Fiberglass is not quite as strong or light as carbon fiber but it is more flexible and easier to join and machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If what you need is available in a commercial frame kit you are normally better off buying it as you will spend more making your own.
<ul>
	<li>It will also take a lot of time and effort to design the copter, to obtain the components and to, cut, drill, machine and fabricate them.</li>
	<li>There is also a strong possibility that design and fabrication mistakes and misperceptions will require that some things get redone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If you have sufficient reason to make your own frame, tube and plate construction is generally the most practical for home production.</li>
	<li>It is reasonable to mix materials, commonly carbon fiber frame tubes and fiberglass central and motor mounting plates.
<ul>
	<li>Carbon fiber and fiberglass tubing and plate can be cut with a hacksaw or power jig or band saw (with metal or fiberglass blades).
<ul>
	<li>It can also be drilled and milled with HSS or TC coated drills and mills, but all tooling wears out very quickly cutting these materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Carbon fiber in particular is tricky to cut, drill and machine, it can tear, shatter or de-laminate if not done smoothly and slowly.
<ul>
	<li>A drill press is mandatory for carbon fiber, you cant center punch a pilot drill hole, so it needs to be held precisely in place.</li>
	<li>Avoid milling of carbon fiber if at all possible, it is very difficult to accomplish satisfactory results.</li>
	<li>You will see carbon fiber plates that have milled slots on consumer copters but these have generally been cut with a water jet.</li>
	<li>With carbon fiber you will generally get better results drilling precision placed holes rather than attempting to mill slots in it.</li>
	<li>You can carefully and slowly cut a carbon fiber plates exterior edges with a power saw and smooth them with a Dremel tool.</li>
	<li>If you must put in slots consider drilling a hole at each end and using a small circular saw on a Dremel or flex shaft to connect them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>It will be necessary to provide appropriate brackets to clamp the motor mounts and central hub to the frame arm tubes.
<ul>
	<li>Tubing needs to be clamped but must not be "crushed", silicone or rubber gasket can provide protection and vibration isolation.</li>
	<li>Hardware should be aluminum or stainless steel machine screws and you can use Nylok nuts or "Blue" Loctite on regular nuts.</li>
	<li>Plate separation and mounting can be provided with Nylon or aluminum standoffs.</li>
	<li>(Note: It would be really nice if somebody made an X internal slip-glue fit ferrule for the center of the frame tubes but they don't - yet!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>There are a wide variety of Carbon fiber and epoxy fiberglass components to choose from.

<h4>Using manufactured Plastic and Fiberglass Components in Your Own Frames.</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">Although often not reasonable to make yourself some parts can be used effectively in your own designs.</strong></li>
	<li>There are retrofit kits like the Team Blacksheep FPV subframe for a DJI Flamewheel quadcopter that reuse it's plastic frame arms.</li>
	<li>And there are many cases where components from various frames can be used to good effect in our own designs.</li>
	<li>Clearly it is necessary to research your individual design to assure that the component pieces are actually available from the distributors.</li>
	<li>Research can provide an excellent source of very desireable components:
<ul>
	<li>Like this effective $15.00 <strong><a href="http://www.steadidrone.ca/extras/">Steadidrones Q4D vibration isolated motor mount</a></strong> for 20mm carbon fiber tubes.</li>

<h4>Homemade waterproof frame using a hinged electrical box</h4>
An absolutely excellent, very clean, rugged and waterproof design using carbon fiber arms and plastic electrical and plumbing parts.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/wavecopterimprovements4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11771" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/wavecopterimprovements4.jpg" alt="wavecopterimprovements4" width="620" height="349" /></a>

	<li>I really like the use of the central 4 way hub for stabilizing the tubes and the slip fit adjustable tension T's for motor mounts are also great.</li>
	<li>The mounting of an APM or Pixhawk would really require the separate GPS / Magnetometer module in order to work correctly.</li>
	<li>There are a wide variety of latch type weatherproof electrical boxes which could be used for this.</li>
	<li>The  main requirement is to get CF tube with an outer diameter appropriate to the plumbing / electrical fittings you want to use.</li>
	<li>I'll definitely be visiting the electrical and plumbing section the next time I'm in Home Depot.</li>

<h4>Vacuum Formed Frames and Components.</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Although this is specialized and requires a vacuum forming "press" it may be justified for some applications.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A vacuum molding press can be made relatively inexpensively that can make whole small shell type frames or for components.</li>
	<li>Copters made this way can be made weather tight and even water proof and they can be incredibly tough.</li>
	<li>Kydex is a laminated plastic sheet that produces a quite strong monocoque shell when molded properly.</li>
	<li>The no longer in production Safe Flight Copters SFC4410-1 vacuum formed propeller protected H Quad Frame.</li>

<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Vacuum forming can also be used to make central shells for copters with tube, plastic or fiber glass frame arms.</li>
	<li>This may be over specialized for most uses, but if you want to make tough, light central frame shells or covers.</li>
	<li>Or, if you want to build multiple small to medium Quadcopters that are tough and waterproof this could be just the ticket.</li>
	<li>(Or you could just buy an Aquacopter frame!!!)</li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h3>Specific Building Examples and Techinques</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Some design considerations for a medium large, high efficiency, heavy lift Quadcopter build.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A simple, rugged and very versatile X Quadcopter with a frame sized large enough to accept 18" diameter propellers might include:</li>
	<li>High quality 20mm carbon fiber tube frame arms with SteadiDrone motor mounts and central frame tube clamps from EBay or China.</li>
	<li>Cut and drilled carbon fiber or fiberglass top and bottom central frame plates mounted to the tube clamps and standoffs.</li>
	<li>A custom or commercial off the shelf landing gear system.</li>
	<li>An optimal Pro configuration might include the top rated $120.00 KDE 4014XF-380KF motors and a 30 amp 3 - 6 cell  four in one ESC.
<ul>
	<li>The motors and ESC would cost about $540.00 and you would get a copter tuneable to lift up to 20+ pounds in total weight.</li>
	<li>It is reasonable to get this configuration to achieve usable 60 minute flight times even with photo or video equipment aboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>A more conservative hobby configuration might include the $40.00 SunnySky X4108S 380KV motors and a 25 amp four in one ESC.
<ul>
	<li>The motors and ESC would cost about $200.00 and you would get a copter tuneable to lift up to 10+ pounds in total weight.</li>
	<li>Even with this setup you could achieve usable flight times in excess of 30 minutes with small to medium consumer size cameras.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Some additional features that need to be considered are:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A third frame plate under the two frame tube sandwiching plates can accommodate the batteries, ESCs and Receiver.</li>
	<li>A vacuum formed, fabricated or adapted top and bottom shell can weatherproof the copter and increase its resistance to mishaps.</li>
	<li>This frame is less than 27" from corner to corner, but props can be removed for transport or folding arms could be incorporated.</li>
	<li>This frame will be very light and strong and it will allow lots of latitude in how it is set up and it will be easy to upgrade.</li>
	<li>It's ability to accept larger props even with an inexpensive power system will provide much better than average flight times.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The copters capabilities will be according to the power system selected, the battery combination used and the total weight.</li>
	<li>You can include a camera gimbal under the center plate, make sure the landing gear does not interfere with the cameras view.</li>
	<li>The landing gear should minimize interference with prop wash and provide strong, resilient and stable support.</li>
	<li>If you really are determined to build your own frame, this is a really good place to start.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Quad18X12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11638" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Quad18X12.jpg" alt="Quad18X1" width="800" height="800" /></a>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The above design is a very capable pro-grade Quadcopter with an exceptionally wide performance and endurance envelope.</strong></li>
</ul>



<h4>A Small Quadcopter Optimised to Use High Efficiency Lithium Batteries</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Modern ultra efficient Lithium batteries can have nearly twice the energy per unit weight of the LiPo batteries we normally use.</li>
	<li>3300 mah 3.7volt Panasonic NCR18650B batteries weigh 47 grams versus a normal LiPo equivalent of about 100 grams per cell.</li>
	<li>Their disadvantage is that their maximum discharge rate is only 2C so 6.6 Amps.</li>
	<li>They will also last for many times the number of charge discharge cycles of our normal LiPos.</li>
	<li>Used properly a copter using these batteries can get nearly twice the flight time of one with the same weight of LiPo batteries.</li>
	<li>The most important factor in designing a copter to use these batteries is to keep the weight low enough that their is sufficient current.</li>
	<li>This quadcopter design uses carefully selected T-Motor MT2206 1200 KV 30 gram motors and 10" props with a light carbon fiber frame.</li>
	<li>It includes a 2S 2P 6600mah lithium battery, flight controller, receiver and even an FPV camera and transmitter.</li>
	<li>It weighs about a pound and since the battery is 2 parallel it can provide 13.2 amps of current (max current is less than 10 amps.)</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php?ecalc">Xcalc computations</a></strong> show that a hover time of 60 minutes might be possible with a realistic fly around time of about 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Quad10X1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11856" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Quad10X1.jpg" alt="Quad10X1" width="800" height="800" /></a>

This is an easy to build example of a practical and rugged design with exceptional capabilities and double the normal flight time.

<h3>A Commercial MultiCopter Exhibiting Advanced Design Concepts</h3>
<strong>Here is an example of an excellent QuadCopter design: the Aeryon SkyRanger for high end UAV applications.</strong>

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/Aeryon_SkyRanger2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11254" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/Aeryon_SkyRanger2.jpg" alt="Aeryon_SkyRanger2" width="601" height="301" /></a>

<strong>This copter has a lot of things right and is really a study in good design and quality construction.</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The rotating ball full enclosure camera Gimbal provides good weather protection and improved performance.</li>
	<li>The motors are on the bottom under the arms.
<ol>
	<li>More aerodynamically efficient with no prop wash interference and very little intake interference.</li>
	<li>Noticeably increased flight times, greater lift capability and quieter as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>High torque, low KV "pancake" style motors and slow turning, large diameter, high efficiency props.
<ol>
	<li>This is much more efficient than faster motors with smaller diameter conventional design props.</li>
	<li>This also increases flight times and load capacity and reduces the sound footprint.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Tapered carbon fiber frame arms are more aerodynamically efficient and are light and very strong.</li>
	<li>The fully enclosed weather tight framework with snap latch type access makes maintaining the copter easy.</li>
	<li>A simple spring loaded landing gear provides for uneven landing sites and minimal interference with the prop wash.</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/Skyranger.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11248" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/Skyranger.jpg" alt="Skyranger" width="350" height="258" /></a>

<strong>This QuadCopter incorporates several excellent design concepts and </strong><strong><strong>shows what can be done without budget constraints.</strong></strong>

<strong><strong>The Skyranger has features we can use in our own designs but it is important to understand all designs are compromises.</strong></strong>

<strong>The 3DRobotics Iris is one of the best designed QuadCopters that you can actually get and it is a real bargain.</strong>



<h3>Conclusion and Additional Design Considerations.</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>I have not covered either 3D printing or CNC machining.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>These are both perfectly valid techniques for either whole frames or for parts or accessories.</li>
	<li>But most people do not have the equipment or capability which is why they are not covered here.</li>
	<li>Clearly if you have either of these capabilities they can greatly enhance your copter projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>I have also not covered in depth hand laid fiberglass or carbon fiber or vacuum bagging.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You can make Dynamite frames or shells this way but this too requires serious individual skill  and capability (especially carbon fiber).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>I have also not gone into detail about the engineering criteria for multicopters:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A. I don't know.</li>
	<li>B. From what I've seen very few people do.</li>
	<li>C. One who does is Paul Pounds PHD and here is his Paper on the subject: <strong><a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/33833/1/33833.pdf">Quadrotors</a></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>If you stick to a simple design and try to keep frame arm to a simple single small tube under the prop wash it will work fine.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Round tubing has about half the flat plate area (prop wash interference) as the same sized square tubing.</li>
	<li>You can improve efficiency by putting the motor prop under the frame arm but then there are frame design and clearance issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Try to keep the weight centralized as much as possible and keep the flight controller near the horizontal center if possible.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>So that the copter tends to roll and pitch as though pivoting around the center of mass and around the flight controller.</li>
	<li>However it is not as critical as some people have made it out to be because the stabilizing throttles will automatically compensate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>You can do a lot with a rudimentary understanding of the forces involved, if you need more it is a career, not a hobby.</strong></li>
</ul>
