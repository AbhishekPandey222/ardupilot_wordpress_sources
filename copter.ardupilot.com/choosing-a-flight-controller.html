There are three readily available autopilots, the <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-pixhawk" target="_blank">Pixhawk</a>, <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/apm-2-6-kit-1" target="_blank">APM2.6</a> and <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/px4-fmu-flight-management-unit-plus-io-input-slash-output-kit" target="_blank">PX4</a>, all sold by 3DRobotics that run the Copter software.  In addition there are clones of the above boards, small variants and then completely original works in various states of development.  This page summarises the main choices.

[note]Although these boards have different CPU performance and even different sensors, the user experience is nearly identical and supported features are still very similar.[/note]
<h3>Pixhawk vs APM2.6 vs PX4</h3>
If choosing between the three 3DR boards, you should generally choose the <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-pixhawk" target="_blank">Pixhawk</a> (<a href="wiki/common-pixhawk-overview/">see specs</a>).  This single board flight controller has an ARM CPU and is based on the earlier PX4 but includes many enhancements.  This is the latest and most advanced of the three boards, with the fastest CPU, most RAM, backup accelerometers and gyros, and supports backup compass and GPS.

The APM2.6 (<a href="wiki/common-apm25-and-26-overview/">see hardware overview</a>) is the final edition of the traditional AVR CPU based ardupilot flight controllers.  The APM was a tried and true champion that was optimised to the fullest to bring us the rich capabilities that got us this far. Unfortunately the Copter firmware now consumes all the available 8 bit AVR memory and CPU performance, so we can no longer add additional enhancements.

[warning]Copter 3.3 firmware (and later) no longer fits on APM boards. The last firmware builds that can be installed (AC v3.2.1) can be downloaded from here: <a title="DIY Drones Firmware" href="http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?did=121">APM2.x</a> and <a title="Copter 3.2.1 Firmware" href="http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?did=120">APM 1.0</a>. [/warning]

The <a href="wiki/common-px4fmu-overview/">PX4</a> (see hardware overview of <a href="wiki/common-px4fmu-overview/">FMU</a> and <a href="wiki/common-px4io-overview/">I/O board</a> components) was the first ARM based board to run Copter.  It, like the Pixhawk, was developed in cooperation with <a href="https://pixhawk.org/" target="_blank">ETH's PX4 team</a>.  With a slightly slower CPU and less RAM than the Pixhawk, its main advantage over the other two boards is its small size.

<h3>Future boards</h3>
The next generation of board will likely run Linux. The most advanced of these is currently the <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/apm4-0-first-copter-flight" target="_blank">APM4.0</a> (aka Pixhawk Fire).
