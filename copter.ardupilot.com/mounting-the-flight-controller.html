The Flight Controller (Pixhawk, PX4, APM2) should be mounted with the white arrow pointing directly towards the front of the vehicle.

It should be attached to the frame using 4 cubes of vibration dampening foam (3DR uses a foam made by <a href="http://www.3m.com/" target="_blank">3M</a>).  <a href="wiki/vibration-damping/">More information on Vibration dampening can be found on this wiki page</a>.

It should be placed close to the center of gravity of the vehicle (both horizontally and vertically).  Generally this means it should be placed within a few centimeters of the middle of the vehicle and level with the motors.  It is not critical that it is placed exactly at the middle (there have not been any recorded cases of problems caused by the controller being far from the COG) but closer is better.

<h3>Alternative orientations</h3>
If the standard orientation of the Pixhawk/APM2 is not convenient, it can be mounted in over 30 other possible orientations.  The full list of possible orientations can be seen and set through the Mission Planner's <strong>Config/Tuning &gt;&gt; Advanced Params's</strong> screen, look for the <code>Board Orientation (AHRS_ORIENTATION)</code> parameter.

For Roll values, positive means roll right (i.e. "Roll90" means board is rolled right 90 degrees so the white arrow still points forward but the board is standing on it's right edge).

For Pitch values, positive numbers indicate pitch back (i.e. "Pitch90" means the board's nose is pitched up 90 degrees so the arrow points directly up)

For Yaw values, positive numbers indicate the nose of the board is rotated clockwise (i.e. "Yaw90" means board is rotated so white arrow points off to the right).
