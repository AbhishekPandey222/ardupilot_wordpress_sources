Until Recently, the simple answer was pretty much "<strong>Fly It</strong>" period. 

However, a few people have been using them to take pictures and even video for some time. But the precision and automated flight options available now provide a rich set of possibilities for current and future uses.
This page provides an overview of current and potential uses of MultiCopters and Traditional Helicopters. It begins with the current common applications and builds from there.
From a practical standpoint learn to walk before you try to run. The FAA is still trying to figure out "Commercial" regulations so for right now these need to be used in strictly unpaid applications. Get a small, inexpensive quadcopter and learn to fly, then proceed carefully and methodically towards your desired goals.



<h3>Just Fly It - But with a difference!</h3>
Flying a radio control <strong>Helicopter</strong> was never easy, and <strong>MultiCopters </strong>can't fly at all without a computer.
We use computers to fly by wire and computers can fly helicopters and multicopters very well indeed.
Modern computer based flight controllers have changed everything.
Our flight controller flies the copter and we simply tell the flight controller what we want it to do.
An <strong>APM</strong> or <strong>Pixhawk</strong> flight controller can do a whole lot more than we ever could flying a copter directly.
We have many different, interesting and exciting <strong>Flight Modes</strong> available to us, each with its considerable capabilities.
<strong>Stabilize</strong> uses the gyros, accelerometers and compass to keep the copter level and pointed where we choose while we "fly" it around.
<strong>Altitude Hold</strong> adds the barometer / altimeter to Stabilize mode to let us set and adjust an automatically held altitude.
<strong>Loiter</strong> adds GPS and inertial position hold so you simply use the RC transmitter to reposition the copter even in wind gusts.
<strong>RTL</strong> makes it possible to automatically <strong>Return To your Launch</strong> point and land if you wish (very useful safety measure).
<strong>Auto</strong> adds preprogrammed Missions where you mark waypoints on a satellite map and the copter follows the course you set.
<strong><strong>Acro</strong> and <strong>Sport</strong> </strong>provide fun high performance flight capabilities with an extended flight envelope, but are not for novices.
All these capabilities and more can be selected while in flight and they provide an incredibly rich and varied flying experience.
Our flight controllers use your personal computer to set them up and program their flight characteristics and automated flights.
The <strong>Mission Planning</strong> program has a graphical satellite map based flight planner and extensive setup and logging capabilities.
A PC or tablet can even serve as a <strong>Ground Control Station </strong>using<strong> 2 way telemetry.</strong>
<strong></strong>You can observe flight progress and copter attitude on a satellite map and HUD display and even control the copter directly.



<h3>First Person View (FPV)</h3>
<strong>First Person View</strong> allows you to fly your copter from the perspective of an actual on board pilot.
You add a color video camera and radio transmitter to your copter and a receiver and LCD display on the ground.
This permits you to look in the display and fly the copter as though you were the <strong>pilot on board</strong>.
Special displays are available in the form of goggles that make the flight experience even more immersive.
<strong>On Screen Display</strong> (OSD) can be added to provide a real time overlay of a <strong>HUD</strong> view of your copters attitude in flight.
While you legally need to operate within <strong>Line Of Sight</strong> an FPV system provides a rich and rewarding flight experience.
FPV allows you to extend your vision much like a pair of binoculars permitting the copter to be used for practical tasks.



<h3>Photography and Videography</h3>
Photography and videography are currently most highly developed applications to provide genuine practical added value.
Copters can provide an excellent positionable (and dollyable) platform for still or motion camera work.
With a small copter you can easily get to locations and take pictures or video you simply cannot get any other way.
Modern <strong>brushless camera gimbals</strong> permit cameras to be effectively <strong>stabilized</strong>.
Gimbals enable the camera to maintain steady alignment even as the copter moves around or pitches in wind gusts.
Gimbals can also permit the camera to be pointed independently of the alignment or motion of the copter.
Small, rugged and powerful <strong>Sport</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> match well with even smaller copters abilities and are easy to use.
The <strong>GoPro</strong> sport cameras have become a standard, many gimbals are made for it and it is in wide spread use.
The GoPro Hero 3 Black is a very powerful still and video camera with many professional capabilities.
It is possible for a light weight inexpensive copter with a sport camera and gimbal to return amazingly professional results.
For situations that demand it you can put together a fully professional copter and gimbal platform for any camera.
Large copter camera systems weigh more, are more hazardous and cost (often considerably) more, but they can deliver stunning results.
Clearly you are much better off starting out on the smaller, less expensive, less dangerous side of this equation.
Much of the potential value of copters is based on their "camera" capabilities, but uses extend way beyond normal photo applications.



<h3>Disaster Response</h3>
OK, your probably not going to be carrying flood victims to safety off of their roof top.
But the video, camera and GPS capabilities mean you can easily find those victims and direct other crews to them.
You can even drop small but critical emergency supplies like phones, radios, beacons, flashlights, first aid or even food.
Our little copters can locate, provide critical supplies, information and assistance while freeing up major resources to do actual recovery.
And you can do all this without putting any additional lives at risk.
Major fires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and even volcanic eruptions provide similar opportunities.
In pretty much any disaster situation, these little copters can be extremely valuable tools in saving lives and providing relief.



<h3>Search and Rescue</h3>
Our little copters can actually be more effective than any other means for locating lost or injured individuals or groups.
The ability to search a grid with IR or FLIR cameras can locate victims where their discovery would be unlikely even with a full sized copter.
And our copters are so cheap a thorough fine grid search can be quickly made using multiples of them for very little expense.
Of course similarly equipped fixed wing planes can extend the search well beyond our little copters range.
An important benefit is that this greatly reduces the danger and exposure of human rescuers or piloted air vehicles.
Once found, the GPS location can guide a full rescue party and emergency communication and aid supplies dropped in.



<h3>Agricultural Applications</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This promises to be one of the most important and earliest adopted civilian uses of Multicopters.</li>
	<li>It has huge economic implications and is generally easier to implement because it is entirely over specific private land.</li>
	<li>For now there are a lot of passive applications that are already in use with more to come.
<ul>
	<li>Tile and drainage inspections</li>
	<li>Barn roof and silo inspections</li>
	<li>Irrigation pivot inspections</li>
	<li>Hail and cattle damage inspection for crop insurance claims</li>
	<li>Scare off wildlife such as deer that are eating crops</li>
	<li>Patrol for hunters on your private land</li>
	<li>Locate missing cattle (This is where a thermal camera comes in handy.)</li>
	<li>Video check-ins for landlords</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forest Fire Mitigation</h3>
The U.S. air tanker fleet is now down to 11 planes and the American Congress has been unwilling to buy more of them.
For America this makes it even more important to be able to keep major fires from getting going in the first place.
The easy ability to position and fly a camera at any altitude has huge implications for fire watch and fire tracking.
This has already begun to have been put into practice because the need is so high it outweighs the FAA's foot dragging.
The recent Yosemite fire in California received a lot of real time information from a civilian version of the Predator drone.
Near and far infrared cameras are excellent for spotting fires, even camp fires and even in heavy cover like trees.
Our little copters have a huge potential role in locating spot fires, illegal campfires and in tracking and informing about active fires.
In addition to indirect and direct fire mitigation, near infrared cameras are very good at informing about flammable brush overgrowth.



<h3>Hazard and Danger Spotting and Mitigation</h3>
In Australia they are starting to use MultiCopters and planes to patrol beach areas looking for swimmers in trouble and for sharks.
This greatly expands their capabilities for saving lives and for reducing unnecessary and undesirable feeding of sharks.
The normal method is to use Helicopters, airplanes and lifeguard spotters on shore, resource scarcity greatly limits effectiveness.
Small copters and planes can readily and cheaply patrol beach areas at just the right altitude and position to spot dangers.
They can even drop rigid or inflatable flotation devices to swimmers in trouble and chemically or electrically discourage sharks.
It can be readily envisaged that this methodology could be utilized wherever crowd dangers exist (ski areas for instance).



<h3>3D Mapping and GIS (Geographic Information Systems)</h3>
Our flight controllers already have a built in GPS.
If you add a downward pointing a camera it is feasible for a copter to fly a preset pattern and capture pictures with GPS coordinates.
With that data you can precisely overlay the photographed objects to the satellite maps or the copters recorded elevations.
You can even use special IR cameras that will illuminate important agricultural and natural resource conditions.
This gives you precisely mapped 3D information with a wide variety of potential applications.
You can determine whether crops are getting enough water or forests are at risk of fire and even the effects of urbanization.
Industrial effects on the surroundings and even local information usable for design, construction and verification.



<h3>Inspection, Verification and Sample Collection</h3>
A variety of Cameras can be installed on a Multicopter and used with FPV there are many opportunities for inspection uses.
Architectural and building inspection and verification: roof condition, construction quality and window and vent seams.
Siting verification, contour analysis, drainage and adherence to plans can also be greatly assisted by a multicopter.
Adding a small probe or collection device can allow difficult to reach or hazardous areas to be accessed for valuable data or samples.
Here is an excellent government back student project for accessing a variety of samples: <strong><a href="http://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-13-23300">Modcopter Sample Collection System</a></strong>

<h3>Payload Based Applications</h3>
We have already touched briefly on this with the delivery of emergency supplies, flotation devices and shark repellent.

But the truth is bread and butter payload based Missions have a huge potential value in the future.
Contrary to the hype, home Pizza delivery is extremely unlikely due to safety, privacy and likely very intractable legal issues.
But rice crop spraying in Japan is already being tested and researched (by our members).



<h3>Work Based Applications (Becoming a Tool)</h3>
Even though our Copters are not very big they can perform extremely important work difficult or impossible to do by other means.
Already in some locations they are being used very successfully to string pull wires for huge Power lines from hilltop to hill top.
Other uses include building and home cleaning and even painting, touch up and maintenance and tree trimming and spraying.
Tethered copters, powered and supplied from the ground will efficiently, quickly and safely paint, wash, spray and trim.
Our little copters will become tools, pure and simple, very powerful, very capable tools.



<h3>The Path Ahead</h3>
Currently our hobby Multicopters commonly have short run times (10 to 15 minutes) and low payload capacity.
Some Helicopters have longer flight times and higher payload capacities, but multicopters are often be the preferred platform.
Our hobby copters of both types often suffer from poor reliability and lack of durability due to the use of low quality components.
But Flight times can be easily increased to the 30+ minute range by using low KV "pancake" motors which turn at slower speeds and allow you to use larger diameter more efficient propellers.
This technique also allows for higher payload capacities and permits you to select a trade-off for the best compromise.
Additionally, higher quality components with extreme durability and longevity are already being manufactured and although they are more expensive than their cheap counterparts, prices are still within reach and are coming down rapidly.
Importantly, the computer controls that are required to even allow us to be able to fly our little copters are evolving at breakneck speed.
Complex automatic navigation and control and soon even situational awareness will permit us to do things we haven't even thought of yet.
This is the path that allows our hobby copters to transition from pastime to tool.
