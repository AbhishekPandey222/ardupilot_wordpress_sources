<h3>Why Vibration damping is important:</h3>



The APM and PX4 Flight Control boards have accelerometers built into the board that are sensitive to vibrations. Copter (the firmware) combines the data from these accelerometers with barometer and GPS data to calculate an estimate of it's position. This position estimate is critical when in AltHold, Loiter, RTL, Guided, Position and AUTO flight modes. With excessive vibrations, the estimate can be thrown off and lead to very bad performance in these modes (i.e. the copter becomes jumpy or flies off).
<h3>Measuring your vibration levels:</h3>



Vibration needs to be less than 0.3 G in the X and Y axes and less than 0.5 G in the Z axis. Please refer to the <a href="wiki/ac_measuringvibration/">Measuring Vibration wiki page</a> for details of how to measure whether your copter's levels are within the acceptable range.



<h3>Additional Vibration Reduction Considerations</h3>



<ol>
	<li>Significant gains in vibration isolation can also be realized by using a high flex wire and strain relief approach to all wires connected to the Flight control board (and using the minimum number of wires necessary as well.)</li>
	<li>Isolation and damping can be improved somewhat by sandwiching the flight control board / enclosure between damping pads on both sides in about twenty percent compression. 30 durometer Sorbothane is actually specified at 15 to 20 percent compression for optimal damping.</li>
	<li>Although 30 durometer Sorbothane seems an excellent candidate, personal experience indicates that it becomes permanently compressed and is not as effective at vibration reduction as the Gel solutions.</li>
	<li>A link to a Blog about the first APM anti-vibration mounting system to achieve 0.05 G damping (2/20/2013 improved to 0.02 G), a dual zone isolation system, combining Oring suspension and silicone pad is <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/very-good-anti-vibration-results-with-following-apm2-5-mount-quad">(Here!)</a></li>
	<li>Propeller balancing is always a good idea and can considerably reduce the vibration transmitted to the airframe in the first place.</li>
	<li>Propeller balancing is not covered in detail here because there are literally hundreds of references to it on line and it is fundamental to RC modeling. Google "RC Propeller Balancing".</li>
	<li>Motor balancing can also reduce vibration and especially so for cheaper or larger motors.</li>
	<li>A quick and clever way to achieve satisfactory motor balancing:</li>
	<li>Tightly fasten a small tie wrap around a motor (WITH NO PROP), trim off the extended tab and spin it up.</li>
	<li>Try multiple times, each time turning the tie wrap on the motor housing a bit until the vibration reduces or goes away.</li>
	<li>A small piece of Scotch tape can be re-positioned instead of the tie wrap if desired or for smaller motors.</li>
	<li>When you locate the spot where there is the least vibration (and you should be able to hear it), mark the spot directly under the clasp of the tie-wrap with a felt pen.</li>
	<li>Add a small dot of hot glue gun glue where the Tie-Wrap clasp was and increase the glue a bit at a time till the vibration is minimized.</li>
	<li>If you put too much glue on it can be removed with an X-acto knife. - Simple but effective.</li>
	<li>Vibration Damping added at the motor mounts can significantly reduce vibration at the airframe, but the vibration damping method and hardware must be matched to the size and performance of your multicopter.</li>

</a></li>
	<li>Camera Mounts also need to be effectively isolated and damped from vibration, but they already have a number of "soft" mounting solutions.</li>
	<li>The camera servos need to be vibration isolated as well, either in the isolated camera mount itself or with their own vibration reduction solution.</li>
	<li>You should use high quality ball joints on your camera servo arms and adequate bearings or bushings in the mount itself with zero free play to prevent inertial slop.</li>
	<li>Quality servos without free play are also a must for precision camera work.</li>
	<li>Some copters can have intrinsically lower than normal vibration characteristics
<ol>
	<li>Frame stiffness / flex and isolated centralized mass can greatly influence motor/prop vibration transfer to the central fight controller.</li>
	<li>Thoughtful top down design has produced some copters with significantly reduced intrinsic vibration levels.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>



&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Since most of our flying takes place well inside the + and - one G range and we are attempting to the movement of our airframe to determine location and level you can see that any vibration greatly interferes with this process.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The APM or PX4's internal firmware filtering can extract sufficient data for inertial navigation from vibration excursions of less than 1/2 G (5 on our scale).</strong></li>
	<li><strong>However, reducing the vibration amplitude of each axis even lower, possibly even below one tenth G is a worthy pursuit and will be rewarded with very stable horizontal and vertical position maintenance and smooth control.</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3>Vibration Damping and Isolation for MultiCopters</h3>



<ol>
	<li>Initial improvements can be made by balancing the props and motors.</li>
	<li>At this point in time it seems that the more rigid the frame the better because frame flex introduces undesirable mechanical delay (hysteresis) in translating motor induced actions to the centrally located flight control board. (Do NOT shock mount the motor Arms).</li>
	<li>It is reasonable to somewhat vibration damp the motor mounts themselves because they are on one end of the mechanism.</li>
	<li>However, the most significant vibration damping gains will be made by properly isolating and or damping the flight control board itself.</li>
	<li>Until now vibration abatement has been simply by trial and error sticking on of Foam or Gel pads or using O-ring suspension of the board to outboard standoffs and yielding highly variable results.</li>
	<li>The acceptability of the outcome has been verified by flight performance and by checking the RAW ACCEL values in the APM flight log.</li>
	<li>This trial and error approach has achieved acceptable to good results, but is by no means optimum.</li>
	<li>The crucial fact that we have not properly addressed is that the amount and type of damping medium needs to be carefully matched to the weight (mass) of the item we are trying to isolate as well as the frequency and amplitude of the vibrations we are seeking to damp.</li>
	<li>In fact we are trying to isolate a flight control board that weighs less than 2 ounces and this is a very small mass.</li>
	<li>Our current seat of the pants "solutions" are often designed for much larger masses and are not nearly as effective for the light mass of our flight control board as they ought to be.</li>
	<li>Virtually all off the shelf solutions (either pad or stud type) are designed for an isolated mass that would weigh at least 5 to 10 times what an APM or PX4 / IO board weighs for optimal effectiveness.</li>
	<li>This includes all pre-made Sorbothane, Alpha gel, EAR, memory foam or other silicone or urethane gel or foam mounts as well as Lord Micro mounts.</li>

<h3>Even More Considerations Relating to Vibration Control</h3>



<ol>
	<li>Eventually it would be very nice to have a solution actually "engineered" for exactly the conditions of our flight control boards.</li>
	<li>Although the "Quick Fixes" listed above do provide useful remedies they are not optimal.</li>
	<li>A threaded stud or sleeve type mount gel mount properly designed for the mass of our flight control board or electronics module undergoing the stress's of normal flight would be a much better long term solution.</li>
	<li>And a system that could actually sandwich the flight control board / enclosure between two layers of appropriate damping material of appropriate size could be even better.</li>
	<li>It is probably a good idea to mount the flight control board as well as the receiver and possibly a clear cover on a separate (vibration damped) mounting plate.</li>
	<li>This would have the advantage of increasing the mass of the item we need to provide vibration reduction for to the point where more conventional and commercially available solutions such as threaded stud or sleeve isolators could be employed effectively.</li>
	<li>It would also reduce the amount of transition wiring necessary by placing the receiver to flight controller wiring entirely within the damped mass.</li>
	<li>It could also make the electronics system more modular and easier to work on.</li>
	<li>For now we can adapt the engineering specifications of the chosen materials to provide the Vibration damping and Isolation we need.</li>
</ol>



<strong>A Summary of the particular vibration characteristics we need to damp:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The vibration frequency and amplitude we primarily need to reduce is a characteristic of the motor / prop units turning at flight speed.</li>
	<li>That is, it is a fairly high frequency with fairly low amplitude.</li>
	<li>This requires that we provide a short coupled damping and isolation range.</li>
	<li>The board itself does not need to have nor benefit from a range of motion that exceeds the amplitude of the vibration.</li>
	<li>Because the board does not apply any force to the airframe, the only thing we need to be concerned with Damping / Isolating is the weight (mass) of the board itself plus the forces applied to it by airframe's normal flight maneuvering.</li>
	<li>Since excellent broad frequency range, high damping materials are available our biggest concern will be to use the proper amount of them to optimally damp our flight control board. (Too much is just as bad as too little.)</li>
	<li>Combining the Flight control board and receiver onto a separate vibration damped electronics module "plate" or enclosure can increase the mass of the module making it easier to damp effectively as well as reducing the interconnecting wiring and making the whole system more modular.</li>
</ol>



<strong>I have used the concept of vibration isolation and damping somewhat interchangeably in this section.</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Isolation is simple undamped (spring or rubber band support) which allows the movement of the isolated object largely separate from the containing object (Automobile spring for instance).</li>
	<li>Damping is the conversion of vibration into heat energy by a shock absorbing medium (Automobile shock absorber for instance.)</li>
	<li>Our ultimate goal here is to provide the most high and medium frequency reduction while still allowing low frequency actual board movement to take place in concert with the airframe with a minimum of delay.</li>
	<li>So realistically our methods embody both Damping and Isolation.</li>
</ol>



<strong>I have covered a lot of ground here, but this is at least a good start for designing some real world vibration solutions .</strong>
