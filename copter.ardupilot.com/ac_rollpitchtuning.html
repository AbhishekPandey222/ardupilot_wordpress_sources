Although there are many gains that can be tuned in Copter to get optimal performance, the most critical is the Rate Roll and Pitch P values which convert the desired rotation rate into a motor output.  This alone will likely get it flying reasonably well at least in Stabilize mode.

Some general advice on how to tune this parameter:
<ul>
	<li>Too high and the copter will oscillate quickly in roll and/or pitch</li>
	<li>Too low and the copter will become sluggish</li>
	<li>High powered copter should use a lower gain, under powered copters are a higher gain</li>
</ul>



<h3>In-flight tuning</h3>
Rate Roll P and Rate Pitch P can be tuned in flight using your transmitter's channel 6 tuning knob by following these instructions:

<ol>
	<li>Connect your APM/Pixhawk/PX4 to the Mission Planner</li>
	<li>On the mission planner, select Config/Tuning &gt;&gt; Copter Pids</li>
	<li>Set the CH6 Opt to "Rate Roll/Pitch kP"</li>
	<li>Set Min to 0.08, Max to 0.20 (most copters ideal gain is within this range although from a small number of copter the Max can be as high as 0.25)</li>
	<li>Push the "Write Params" button</li>
	<li>Turn your transmitter's CH6 tuning knob to the minimum position, press the "Refresh Params" button and ensure that the Rate Roll P and Rate Pitch P values become 0.08 (or something very close)</li>
	<li>Turn the CH6 knob to it's maximum position, press "Refresh Params" and ensure the Rate Roll P moves to 0.20</li>
	<li>Move the CH6 knob back to the middle</li>
	<li>Arm and fly your copter in Stabilize mode adjusting the ch6 knob until you get a copter that is responsive but not wobbly</li>
	<li>After the flight, disconnect your lipo battery and reconnect the APM to the mission planner</li>
	<li>With the CH6 knob in the position that gave the best performance, return to the Copter Pids screen and push the "Refresh Params" button</li>
	<li>In the Rate Roll P and Rate Pitch P fields re-type the value that you see but just slightly modified so that the mission planner recongises that it's changed and resends to the APM/PX4 (Note: if you re-type exactly the same number as what appears in Rate Roll P it won't be updated).  So for example if the Rate Roll P appears as "0.1213" make it "0.1200"</li>
	<li>Set Ch6 Opt back to "None" and push "Write Params"</li>
	<li>Push the Disconnect button on the top right, and the Connect</li>
	<li>Ensure that the Rate Roll P value is the value that you retyped in step #12</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Note: while you are moving the tuning knob the values update at 3 times per second.  The need to press the Refresh button in the mission planner in steps #6 and #7 above is just because the Copter is not sending the updates to the mission planner in real-time.
