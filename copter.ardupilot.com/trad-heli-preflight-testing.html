Before your first flight, please follow these pre-flight checks:

[warning]The engine should be disconnected to prevent injury. Be careful! A spinning propeller can cause serious injury![/warning]

<ul>
	<li>Ensure the miniUSB connector is disconnected from the APM</li>
	<li>Connect the battery to the ESC</li>
</ul>

<h1>Test leaning the helicopter in Stabilise mode</h1>
<ul>
	<li>By hand, roll the helicopter to the left. The swash plate should lean to the right.</li>
	<li>Roll the helicopter to the right. The swash plate should lean to the left.</li>
	<li>Pitch the helicopter down (i.e. nose down). The swash plate should lean backwards.</li>
	<li>Pitch the helicopter up (i.e. nose up). The swash plate should lean forwards.</li>
	<li>Rotate the helicopter quickly clockwise - the tail servo should move as if you had pushed the rudder control left (i.e. it's should try to fight against the rotation)</li>
	<li>Rotate the helicopter quickly counter-clockwise - the tail servo should move as if you had pushed the rudder control right (i.e. it's should try to fight against the rotation)</li>
	<li>Next rotate the helicopter slowly. You should find that in a certain direction the rudder stays in the middle. This is the APM trying to hold that heading.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Test the transmitter in Stabilise mode</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Using the transmitter, move the roll stick to the left. The swashplate should lean slightly to the left.</li>
	<li>move the roll stick to the right. The swashplate should lean slightly to the right.</li>
	<li>Move the pitch stick forward. The swashplate should lean slightly forward.</li>
	<li>Move the pitch stick back. The swashplate should lean slightly backwards.</li>
	<li>Move the yaw stick to the left or right. The tail should move in the same direction (and about the same amount) as when you are in manual mode.</li>
</ul>
