<strong>Tips on mounting the GPS module</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It doesn't matter which way the GPS module is oriented, as long as the square antenna side is facing up</li>
	<li>It's best to mount the GPS as far away from radio transmission equipment (like your telemetry or video transmitters) as possible.</li>
	<li>Ideally, the GPS module will have a clear view of the sky, and not be under any spinning props. On top of your multicopter is a good choice.</li>
</ul>
