Other features that aren't specific to the modes already described in the menu at left:
<ul>
	<li>You can display video from your aircraft on the Mission Planner's HUD if you are digitizing it with the same laptop (with a video capture card or USB device). Just select the device in the Configuration/Planner screen, chose video format and press "Start" to begin recording. If you select the HUD checkbox, the video display will replace the artificial horizon in the HUD.</li>
</ul>

	<li>You can also record the video that you're displaying to an AVI file. Just right-click in the HUD and choose from the menu that will pop up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You can send NMEA (GPS) output to the serial port. Press control-g and you will get a box asking for a comport and baud rate to output standard nmea data at 2 hz, to any serial port. One application would be to use com2com to emulate a serial port to use with third party applications.</li>
