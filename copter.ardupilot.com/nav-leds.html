This article shows how to connect external LEDs and buzzers to Pixhawk and APM2, and how to enable/disable the buzzer in Mission Planner.

<h1>External LED for Pixhawk</h1>

An external Pixhawk LED can be added by connecting it to the Pixhawk's I2C port. Because most users use an <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-gps-ublox-with-compass" target="_blank">Ublox GPS and Compass module</a>, an <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/pixhawk-i2c-splitter" target="_blank">I2C splitter</a> is recommended.  Once connected the similar LED on the center of the Pixhawk will no longer light up.

<h1>Two External LED solutions for APM2</h1>

There are two recommended solutions for adding LEDs to your APM/Copter
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="http://store.jdrones.com/jD_IOBoard_p/jdioboard11.htm" target="_blank">JDrones I/O board</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Q2oT808mJnQ" target="_blank">video here</a>) and <a href="http://store.jdrones.com/Night_Flying_LED_Drivers_s/94.htm" target="_blank">LED strips</a> listens to the mavlink messages on the APM/PX4's telemetry port (much like the <a href="wiki/common-on-screen-display-for-fpv/" target="_blank">minimOSD</a>)  and updates the LEDs.  The board includes a voltage regulator so it takes power directly from the battery</li>
	<li>the APM's A4 ~ A11 pins can be used to control LEDs directly.  <a href="http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/apm-2-x-led-buzzer-modules" target="_blank">This is an example of a community members solution</a> you can purchase or you can build your own by purchasing a Darlington Driver DIP chip (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/312" target="_blank">like this one from Sparkfun</a>) to allow you to power the LEDs from the battery.  See this <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/adding-external-led-indicators-and-a-piezo-beeper-for-arm-and-gps" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/leds01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2983" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/leds01.jpg" alt="UPDATE THIS IMAGE" width="700" height="350" /></a>

If you choose to control the pins directly from the APM, you must choose LEDs which have a current draw lower than the maximum permissible current of the AVR chip on the APM: 40mA.

For <strong>AC3.1.5</strong>, the pinout of the APM is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>A4 : AUX led</li>
	<li>A5 : Beeper - can drive a piezo buzzer directly (see below)</li>
	<li>A6 : GPS - will flash with no GPS lock, solid with GPS lock</li>
	<li>A7 ~ A11 : Motor LEDs</li>
</ul>
Which LEDs are active and when they blink is somewhat configurable through the LED_MODE parameter which can be set from the Mission Planner's CONFIG/TUNING &gt; Standard Params &gt; Copter LED Mode drop down.

For <strong>AC3.2</strong>, the LED_MODE parameter is removed but all the following reduced set of pins are always active:
<ul>
	<li>A4 : Motor LED</li>
	<li>A5 : Beeper - can drive a piezo buzzer directly (see below)</li>
	<li>A6 : GPS - will flash with no GPS lock, solid with GPS lock</li>
	<li>A7: Arming LED</li>
</ul>



<h1>Buzzer for APM2</h1>

A piezo buzzer like <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062399" target="_blank">this one from RadioShack</a> can be connected directly to the APM's A5 pins.  If purchasing a different piezo beeper, you must ensure that the piezo is internally modulated, meaning that it creates it's own tone when simply driven with a 5V input.  Some piezo beepers rely on external circuitry to create the tone, this is typically done to play music with multiple notes, but the APM is not capable of driving these.  If you hook up a piezo, and all you hear is a &lt;click&gt;, then you know it is not internally modulated.  Also note that any piezo beeper being used must have a current draw below 40 mA.

Connect the buzzer as follows:
<ul>
	<li>buzzer's red wire should be connected to the APM's A5's inner signal pin</li>
	<li>buzzer's black wire should be connected to the outer ground pin</li>
</ul>

The buzzer will beep in these situations:
<strong> Arming</strong>: twice at the beginning of the arming procedure, and then again twice when completed (Copter can take a long time to arm especially the first time).
<strong> Disarming</strong>: once when the pilot disarms the copter
<strong> Low Battery</strong>: continuous tone when the battery voltage is low. The only way to turn off the tone is to arm or disarm the copter.

In AC3.2 the buzzer is always enabled, for AC3.1.5, the buzzer can be enabled/disabled through the Mission Planner's CONFIG/TUNING &gt; Standard Params &gt; Copter LED Mode drop down.
