Sport Mode is also known as "rate controlled stabilize" plus Altitude Hold.


<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
	<li>It was designed to be useful for flying FPV and filming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_shot" target="_blank">dolly shots</a> or fly bys because you can set the vehicle at a particular angle and it will maintain that angle.</li>
	<li>The pilot's roll, pitch and yaw sticks control the rate of rotation of the vehicle so when the sticks are released the vehicle will remain in it's current attitude.</li>
	<li>The vehicle will not lean more than 45 degrees (this angle is adjustable with the ANGLE_MAX parameter)</li>
	<li>The altitude is maintained with the altitude hold controller so the vehicle will attempt to hold it's current altitude when the sticks are placed with 10% of mid-throttle. It will climb or descend at up to 2.5m/s (this speed is adjustable with the PILOT_VELZ_MAX parameter)</li>
