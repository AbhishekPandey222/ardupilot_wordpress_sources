First-time setup of the autopilot includes downloading and installing the <em>Mission Planner</em> GCS, mounting the flight controller to the frame, connecting it to the receiver, power and motors, and then performing initial configuration and calibration.

[note]This section assumes that you've already <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/choosing-a-frame/">chosen and built a frame</a> and have <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-choosing-a-flight-controller/">selected your flight controller</a>. [/note]
