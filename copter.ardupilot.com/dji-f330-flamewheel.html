This article provides and overview of the DJI F330 FlameWheel QuadCopter, and instructions for how it may be assembled.


<h1>The DJI F330 FlameWheel is inexpensive, sturdy and small.</h1>
<ul>
	<li>It can be flown indoors or out.</li>
	<li>Even though it is compact, the F330 is substantial and can easily carry a battery that will permit 15 minute flights.</li>
	<li>The F330 can carry a GoPro type camera or FPV system if desired.</li>
	<li>The ARF (Almost Ready to Fly) kit is a super bargain and includes motors, ESCs (Electronic Speed Controls) and Propellers.</li>
	<li>The DJI Motors and ESCs provided in the ARF kit are of high quality, very durable and long lasting.</li>
	<li>The frame is extremely rugged and all replacement parts are readily available and inexpensive.</li>
</ul>


<h1>The DJI F450 Flamewheel is an excellent larger alternative to the F330</h1>
<ul>
	<li>The F450 FlameWheel ARF kit has a larger frame, 30 amp ESCs and 10" props for only $10.00 more than the F330.</li>
	<li>The F450 is well suited to carrying a GoPro camera, brushless gimbal, landing gear and a larger battery for longer flights.</li>
	<li>The F330 and F450 FlameWheel are excellent platforms for the PX4 and PixHawk Flight controllers as well as the APM.
<ul>
	<li>I  have, in fact, converted my personal F330 to use the PX4 flight controller with great success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I strongly recommend the F330 and F450 ARF kits, they are reliable, rugged and inexpensive and are suitable for many uses.
<ul>
	<li>The quality is excellent, the components provide long trouble free service, and replacement parts are cheap and available.</li>
	<li>I genuinely don't think you can find a better deal in an APM / PX4 / Pixhawk compatible MultiCopter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Components required in addition to the Flamewheel ARF kit</h1>
<ul>
	<li>A Flight Control Board (APM 2.6, PX4FMU + PX4IO or Pixhawk) with UBlox GPS module and power supply module.</li>
	<li>RC equipment: RC transmitter and a 5+ channel radio receiver (PPM-SUM compatible for PX4 or Pixhawk).</li>
	<li>A 3 cell 1800mah to 2650mah LiPo battery and an appropriate battery Charger.</li>
	<li>Miscellaneous: female to female 3 wire receiver / servo cables, a battery strap, tie wraps and some assorted hardware.</li>
	<li>You will also need an adjustable soldering iron, rosin cored solder, blue thread locker and some small Metric Allen wrenches.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Frame and Motor Assembly</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Go to the DJI web site Flamewheel support section <a href="http://www.dji-innovations.com/download/flame-wheel-arf-downloads/">(Here!)</a> to get a PDF copy of their "manual" none is included in the kits.
<ul>
	<li>It is more of an assembly diagram than a manual, but the pictures are definitely useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The DJI instructions show soldering the ESCs to the Power Distribution Board (bottom frame plate) first.
<ul>
	<li>In our example they were put in after frame assembly because it makes it possible to fit things more closely.</li>
	<li>But it does require a bit of creativity when soldering the ESC leads to the bottom plate / power distribution board.</li>
	<li>Your choice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Use Blue or purple removable thread locker very sparingly on the threads of the Allen screws when you assemble the frame.
<ul>
	<li>Try to keep excess thread locker off of the plastic. This is not actually achievable, but do the best you can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Motor and frame screws have a shoulder on them and you need to tighten them all sufficiently so that the shoulder fully seats.
<ul>
	<li>A good method is to install all screws (with Locktite) loosely then tighten all the screws on each frame arm one at a time.</li>
	<li>Do this in one sitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>When installing the motors, pre-bend the motor leads upward where they exit the motor bottom so that the motor can sit flat.
<ul>
	<li>Have the leads exit towards the center of the copter.</li>
	<li>Motor bottom screws are off set and it can only be installed 2 ways, toward the center is correct.</li>
	<li>The motor screws are short and it is tricky to start the first screw on the motor bottom.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the motor leads are not pushing the motor up.</li>
	<li>Use blue Locktite on each screw and install all 4 screws for a motor loosely and then tighten them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Thread the motor leads down through the first 2 large frame member holes.
<ul>
	<li>Or you can run them around the frame member if you prefer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>ESC Installation and Soldering the Power Distribution Board</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Install the ESCs with tie wraps.
<ul>
	<li>Thread the Tie Wraps from front to back through the frame members and between the motor bullet connector sockets.</li>
	<li>Install the ESC power leads through the slot under the bottom of the frame member.</li>
	<li>Then trim and solder them to the power distribution board.</li>
	<li>This is a little harder than going around the outside of the frame but is neater and provides a little more battery clearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The above illustration shows a power distribution "Y" connector which functions the same as the FlameWheel's built in power distribution board.</li>
	<li>When you solder the ESC and Battery power leads to the power distribution board.
<ul>
	<li>Flux and preheat both the pads and the wire in order to get a properly tinned (wet) solder joint.</li>
	<li>The board can soak up quite a bit of heat so set your soldering iron sufficiently hot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The DJI ARF FlameWheel kits have Opto ESCs which do not include a BEC so you will need an external power supply.
<ul>
	<li>The APM, PX4 and Pixhawk are now available with a power supply you can use, other wise you will need to buy a BEC.</li>
	<li>Castle Creations makes an excellent and very reliable 10/5 amp BEC for about $20.00.</li>
	<li>Use a switching BEC in any case, they are more reliable and a lot more efficient than linear ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You do not need to and in fact can't balance the DJI ESCs as shown elsewhere in the Copter Wiki.
<ul>
	<li>DJI ESCs are digital, optically isolated, are completely pre-balanced at the factory and work fine out of the box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Reduced Vibration Installation of the Flight Control Board</h1>
<ul>
	<li>The Flight controllers require special attention be paid to removing as much vibration from the flight control board as possible.
<ul>
	<li>This F330 FlameWheel has a special anti-vibration suspension mounting of the APM flight controller.</li>
	<li>It uses a folded over 1/16" O-ring at each corner of the flight control board around a screw sticking out of a small standoff.</li>
	<li>If you choose to use this method leave 1/10" to 1/8" clearance from each board corner for proper short coupled spacing.</li>
	<li>The F330 requires minor surgery with a Dremel tool on each frame arm to achieve proper hole spacing in the top plate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Kyosho Zeal Gel is an easy to install and fully satisfactory alternative to the O-ring suspension method.
<ul>
	<li>Simply put a 3/4 inch square of adhesive backed Kyosho Zeal Gel under each corner of the flight controller.</li>
	<li>And secure the flight controller with a Velcro strap over 1/2" of soft foam in light tension. (Do NOT over tighten!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Either the Kyosho Zeal Gel or the O-ring suspension method will allow you to limit vibration to about 1/10 G which is fine.</li>
	<li>Anti-vibration techniques, methods and "tuning" are covered in greater detail in the Anti-Vibration section of the Wiki: <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-vibration-damping/">(Here!)</a></li>
	<li>Compensation for compass interference from the motors is covered: <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-magnetic-interference/">(Here!)</a></li>
	<li>Correct wiring of The Flight Control Board board and configuration for flight are covered extensively elsewhere in the Wiki.</li>
</ul>

[note]*The Velcro on the board and frame above is not in use and is not actually touching*[/note]


<h1>Getting Ready to Fly</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Our construction method allows the battery to be inserted between the two frame plates.
<ul>
	<li>This is an optimal location regarding the QuadCopter's center of gravity.</li>
	<li>The 2650mah LiPo Turnigy Nano battery used here is as large as will comfortably fit, but it will permit 15 minute plus flights.</li>
	<li>Cover bottom frame power distribution solder joints with liquid electrical tape or silicone to prepare for the battery.</li>
	<li>Wrap the battery in bubble wrap and tape it in place to provide additional electrical isolation from the solder joints.</li>
	<li>This will also provide cushioning from vibration and sub-optimal "landings".</li>
	<li>Use a Velcro battery strap through the frames bottom slots to retain the battery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The stock 8" DJI props that are supplied with the F330 ARF kit work fine.
<ul>
	<li>However the F330 FlameWheel can definitely benefit from a 9" prop (10" will not fit on the F330).</li>
	<li>GemFan 9" multirotor "Carbon Filled" props are only $2.00 each and are superior to the stock 8" props.</li>
	<li>These GemFans are almost impossible to break and the 9" ones are considerably more efficient than the stock 8" props.</li>
	<li>9" GemFan propellers are not made to fit the oval hubs of the DJI Motors.</li>
	<li>But you can carefully bore them out to about .31" with an ordinary drill and they will fit perfectly.</li>
	<li>On My F450 Flamewheel, I use 11" GemFan propellers bored out the same way.</li>
	<li>Generally a larger prop diameter is better so long as you don't exceed motor or ESC maximums or cause over heating.</li>
	<li>Make sure the propellers are right side up (printing on top), this won't fly worth a damn if they are upside down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The ESCs and motors automatically disarm after 10 seconds without the motor turning.
<ul>
	<li>So anytime you have remained stationary (on the ground) for over 10 seconds you will need to rearm.</li>
	<li>This is an excellent safety feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You will need to Install Mission Planner software on your PC as instructed elsewhere in this Wiki.
<ul>
	<li>You will then need to use Mission Planner to load the QuadCopter firmware to your flight controller.</li>
	<li>And you will then need to set up various flight parameters for your FlameWheel in the Mission Planner.</li>
	<li><span style="color: red;">(Do Not Attempt to Calibrate the DJI Opto ESCs and Do Not install the propellers until directed to do so).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>To prepare to fly place your copter on your takeoff location, turn your transmitter on and plug in the copter's battery.
<ul>
	<li>(If you have a PX4 or Pixhawk flight controller depress the start button for five seconds).</li>
	<li>The ESC's should emit a short series of musical notes and then be quiet.</li>
	<li>You are then ready to arm by holding the throttle stick down and to the right for 5 seconds.</li>
	<li>After arming you must throttle up the motors within 10 seconds or you will need to re-arm.</li>
	<li>When you are done flying disarm by holding the throttle down and to the left for 5 seconds and disconnect the battery.</li>
	<li>A good set of initial PIDs for flying the FlameWheel F330 or F450 in Stabilize Mode (as of Copter version 3.0.1) are:</li>
	<li>Rate (Roll &amp; Pitch) P = .09 and I = .045 and Stabilize (Roll &amp; Pitch) P = 4.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
