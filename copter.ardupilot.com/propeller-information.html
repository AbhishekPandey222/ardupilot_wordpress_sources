<h3>Recognizing clockwise and counterclockwise propellers</h3>
<img class="alignnone  wp-image-10921" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/01/prop_direction.jpg" alt="prop_direction" width="659" height="439" />
The diagrams above shows two types of propellers: clockwise (called pushers) and counterclockwise (called pullers).

Pusher propellers are often marked with a P. However not all propellers are marked and both types are often available in either rotational direction. Therefore, it is most reliable to recognize the correct propeller type by its shape as shown.

Note that the propellers below have the edge with the shallow consistent curve at the leading edge in direction of rotation and the more radical scalloped (and usually thinner edge) as the trailing edge. You can use these features to recognize propellers of the correct direction of rotation.

Both pusher type and puller type propellers are available in both CW and CCW rotations.

Most of our "conventional" multicopters use tractor (puller) type propellers but on Coaxial copter (Y6, X8) the lower motors will require pusher type propellers and there are also pusher configurations for normal Tri, Quad, Hex and Octo copters as well.

Using good quality propellers and statically balancing them will improve performance and flight times and reduce vibration.
