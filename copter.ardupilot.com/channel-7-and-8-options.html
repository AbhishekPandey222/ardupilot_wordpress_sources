By default, Channel 7 is configured to save the current location as a waypoint (see "Save WP" below) but you can change the default behavior from the Mission Planner's Software &gt; Copter Pids screen.

Here are the options:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Option</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Flip
</strong></td>
<td>Vehicle will flip is on roll axis.  Vehicle will rise for 1 second and then rapidly roll.  The vehicle will not flip again until the switch is brought low and back to high. Give yourself at least 10m of altitude before trying flip for the first time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Simple Mode
</strong></td>
<td>The copter moves left, right, forward and back as if it were facing in the same direction as when it took off regardless of the copter's heading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RTL
</strong></td>
<td>Return-to-Launch. The vehicle will first climb to a safe altitude (defined by RTL_ALT parameter), then return home, pause over home for 5 seconds (configurable by RTL_LOIT_TIME parameter) then descend to 2m or land (configurable by RTL_ALT_FINAL parameter).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Save Trim
</strong></td>
<td>Adjust the vehicle level position using the current roll and pitch stick inputs. See details <a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/autotrim/">here</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Save WP
</strong></td>
<td>Save the current location (including altitude) as a waypoint in the mission. If in AUTO mode no waypoint will be saved, instead the vehicle will RTL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Multi Mode
</strong></td>
<td>Ch6 tuning knob position controls which of the following 3 functions is invoked when ch7 or ch8 switch put in the on position.
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Ch6 &lt;1200 : Flip</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Ch6 1201 ~ 1799 : RTL</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Ch6 &gt; 1800 : Save Waypoint</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>ResetToArmedYaw</strong></td>
<td>Vehicle will turn to face the same direction that it was facing when it was first armed (e.g. at take-off).  An alternative to simple mode when you've lost orientation and need to bring the craft home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Super Simple Mode
</strong></td>
<td>Similar to simple mode except controls are relative home position. Move the pitch stick forward and the copter will fly away from home, pull pitch back and it will return. Move roll stick left or right and the copter to orbit home regardless of the copter's actual heading.</td>

<h3>Check Ch7 &amp; Ch8 PWM values reach 1800</h3>
Your channel 7 and/or channel 8 pwm value must reach at least 1800 PWM or the auxiliary function will not be activated.  You can check that it surpasses this threshold using the Mission Planner's radio config page.
