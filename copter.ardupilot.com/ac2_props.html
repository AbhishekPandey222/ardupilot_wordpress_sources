You'll need two kinds of props (puller and pusher). Pusher props go clockwise; regular (puller) props go counterclockwise. If you get the full kit with motors, these are included.

<strong>NOTE!
</strong> Sometimes some manufacturers call pushers as pullers and pullers as pushers. To be clear on this make sure that air flows downwards when you start motors if not, swap your propeller order. Motor should always spin on direction as shown on pictures above.

It's a very good idea to balance your props; vibration is a multicopter's worst enemy. You can get a

for just a few dollars, or just tape a rod to a box as shown in the video below.
<strong>If you are using 12" props, this is MUST. They can often be badly unbalanced and not only throw off the autopilot but also dislodge parts from your copter.
</strong> If your copter arms are shaking, it's just a matter of time before disaster strikes!

Here's a video on how to do it, balancing the props with a little clear tape:
