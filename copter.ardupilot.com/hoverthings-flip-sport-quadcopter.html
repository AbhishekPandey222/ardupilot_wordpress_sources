<h1>Why a FLIP Sport?</h1>
<ul>
	<li>The easiest inexpensive high quality build your own project is either the F330 or 450 DJI FlameWheel QuadCopter.</li>
	<li>The F330 build is detailed elsewhere and the F450 is pretty much identical.</li>
	<li>I really love those little FlameWheels for delivering many hours of fun and resisting my every effort to destroy them.</li>
	<li>This time I thought I'd try and kick it up a notch, something even more indestructible and maybe even more fun.</li>
	<li>The Flip frame kit is $89.00 from Hoverthings.</li>
	<li>In addition to the standard Sport frame kit I also purchased an extended tab pair of center frame pieces and some extra 7/8" stand offs.</li>
	<li>It is billed as being nearly indestructible and short of direct Nuclear blast effects, they are probably right.</li>
	<li>The frame arms on these Flips are billed as being incredibly stiff and incredibly strong.</li>
	<li>The arms are CNC milled high density 1/4" thick fiberglass and are very stiff, they should be able to withstand a lot of punishment.</li>
	<li>The frame centers are also very strong and stiff fiberglass and it it seems likely all of it is G10.</li>
	<li>This is a small 380 size frame and will accommodate 10" propellers (Right between the Flamewheel F330 and F450.)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assembling the frame</h1>
<ol>
	<li>There are two different construction methods depending on whether you are using a Pixhawk or a PX4.</li>
	<li>For the Pixhawk you will use the second untabbed center plate on top as shown above, for a PX4 you will not.</li>
	<li>Construction procedure is as follows (Use blue Locktite on all machine screws.)</li>
	<li>Assemble the 2 tabbed center sections with four 7/8" standoffs on the 2 holes an inch apart 2" in from the end on 2 opposing sides.</li>
	<li>Mount the arms to the top of one of the tabbed center frames using the short standoffs above the arm and use locktite.
<ol>
	<li>Ensure that the standoffs mounting the two tabbed frame sections are on either side of your copter, not front to back.</li>
	<li>Put the longer screws up through the tabbed plate and arms (2 on the outside 1 in the middle towards the middle) into the short standoffs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Insert and your four in one ESC in between the arms with the excess Motor wire wrapped around the ESC
<ol>
	<li>Leave about 3 inches of the 3 ESC motor wires sticking out under each arm (I also braided each motors wires on mine.)</li>
	<li>Leave the ESC signal wires and power leads sticking out the back (between the 2 black arms on mine.).</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Put an untabbed frame plate on top of your frame and secure with 12 screws to the top of the standoffs.</li>
	<li>Install your DJI motors onto the frame arms with the supplied screws (use Locktite) with the motor wires facing the copter.</li>
	<li>Thread the motor wires through the top frame arm opening and connect to the ESC wires (tuck excess lead into frame).</li>
</ol>

<h1>Installing the Pixhawk flight controller</h1>
<ol>
	<li>If you are using a Pixhawk, mount the 4 remaining 7/8" long standoffs, directly over the ones securing the bottom frame plates.</li>
	<li>Place a 1" square of the Double-sided foam tape that came with the Pixhawk on the bottom of it at each corner.</li>
	<li>Adhere the Pixhawk to the top of the frame with the arrow pointing to the front (between the 2 orange arms on mine).</li>
	<li>Drill a hole through the top 2 frame plates near a frame arm near the edge on one side to accommodate the "safety" button.</li>
	<li>Also mount the buzzer on the top frame member on one side where it will not interfere with a receiver installation.</li>
	<li>Connect the 3DR power module to the Pixhawk connector and attach the power module out of the way also.</li>
	<li>Solder the other end of the power module wires into a battery connector along with the ESC battery leads.</li>
	<li>Install the ESC's signal leads into the Pixhawk (Main Out) servo connectors (signal wire on top).
<ol>
	<li>Red wire into 1, Orange into 2, White into 3 (with red and black below) and Brown into 4.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Install the GPS and magnetometer wires into the GPS/Compass module and the Pixhawk.</li>
	<li>Mount your receiver with double sided tape or Velcro on the top frame member to one side of (and not touching) the Pixhawk.
<ol>
	<li>Run a single servo lead from the PPM-Sum output of the receiver to the left side (RC) input of the Pixhawk.</li>
	<li>Or if it is a Spektrum Satellite run the Spektrum receiver lead to the Spektrum socket on top of the Pixhawk.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Mount the top untabbed frame member over the Pixhawk to the 7/8" standoffs you already installed above.</li>
	<li>Mount the GPS module to the top center of the top frame plate using double sided tape.</li>
</ol>



<h1>Installing the Px4 FMU / PX4IO flight controller</h1>
<ol>
	<li>If you are using a PX4 we can't use the top frame plate but can construct a little hard top if desired.</li>
	<li>Cut a 2" by 2" rectangle from scrap plastic or fiberglass to support the PX4.</li>
	<li>Drill 4 holes in the rectangle that line up with the mounting hole in the PX4 board (roughly centered)</li>
	<li>using 4 of the supplied black screws, mount 4 standoffs to the rectangle.</li>
	<li>Insert the PX4FMU board (connector side up) over the 4 standoff studs and (carefully) screw 4 more standoffs over them.</li>
	<li>Carefully fasten 4 nuts over the exposed studs securing the PX4 modules to the rectangle you made.</li>
	<li>Place the PX4IO board over the PX4FMU board so that the connector is aligned and push down over the studs.</li>
	<li>Place a 3/4" square piece of the Kyosho zeal at each edge of the "rectangle" between the standoff screws.</li>
	<li>Adhere the rectangle to the center of the top of the frame with the servo connector facing to the rear (between the black frame arms).</li>
	<li>Drill a hole through the top 2 frame plates near a frame arm near the edge on one side to accommodate the "safety" button.</li>
	<li>Also mount the buzzer on the top frame member behind the PX4 stack such that it does not touch the "rectangle".</li>
	<li>Insert the power connector into the PX4IO board and solder the power leads and the ESC power leads to a battery connector.</li>
	<li>Connect the buzzer and "Safety" button leads to the PX4 boards.</li>
	<li>Install the ESC's signal leads into the PX4IO board servo connectors (signal wire on top).</li>
	<li>
<ol>
	<li>Red wire = right pins, Orange = 2nd from right, White = 3rd from right (with red and black below) and Brown = 4 from right.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Mount your receiver with double sided tape or Velcro on the top frame member to one side of (and not touching) the "rectangle".
<ol>
	<li>Ensure that your receiver does not block the USB connector on the side of the PX4FMU board (put it on the other side).</li>
	<li>Run a single servo lead from the PPM-Sum output of the receiver to the far left side of the Px4IO servo connector.</li>
	<li>Or if it is a Spektrum Satellite receiver run the Spektrum receiver lead to the Spektrum socket on top of the Pixhawk.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>To use the remaining frame plate as a top cover screw the 4 standoffs to the top of the frame using existing holes near the edge.
<ol>
	<li>Screw the plate to the 4 standoffs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>You can make your own top cover from a rectangle of plastic or fiberglass (I used Plexiglass, transparent is useful).
<ol>
	<li>Ensure that the rectangle is of appropriate size and shape to permit you to secure the standoffs to the top plate.</li>
	<li>Drill holes in the rectangle at the appropriate locations and if needed into the top frame member as well.</li>
	<li>Attach the standoffs to the top frame member and to the Rectangular top you have made.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Adhere the GPS/Compass module to the center of the top of the top cover (it doesn't matter which way it is facing).
<ol>
	<li>Connect the GPS / Compass module to the PX4IO with the supplied wiring cables.</li>
	<li>Note my setup uses an older style UBlox standalone GPS which I have mounted directly to the PX4 stack.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<h1>Final assembly</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Mount the battery between the lower frame sections and secure it with a Velcro strap inserted through the bottom frame plate slots.</li>
	<li>Route and secure the wires and cables with Zip Ties as shown to prevent snagging on the propellers or anything else.</li>
	<li>Ensure that the battery cable is secure but accessible to be plugged in when needed.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Setup and additions</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Your Flip can now be configured as described elsewhere in this wiki for Pixhawk (recommended) or PX4.</li>
	<li>For a PX4 set both board and compass orientation parameters to "Roll 180" because it is installed upside down for connector access.</li>
	<li>There is space for a 3DR telemetry radio and / or an OSD and FPV transmitter between the 2 side tabs.
<ol>
	<li>An FPV camera may easily be mounted in front of the battery between the 2 front tabs.</li>
	<li>If you use FPV keep it's transmitter and antenna well away from the GPS.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The Flip has more than adequate power to support a GoPro camera with a brushless gimbal and the necessary extended landing gear.</li>
	<li>I have had several crashes and only managed to break 2 props while trying (unsuccessfully) to cut down a 80' bull pine tree with them.</li>
	<li>This little copter is very high performance, fully acrobatic, surprisingly efficient and nearly indestructible and it is a blast to fly.</li>
</ol>
