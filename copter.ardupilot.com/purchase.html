<h1>Get it!</h1>
If you're just starting, we recommend you get a full kit. If you're handy with a soldering iron and are looking for a fun assembly project, get an unassembled version. If you just want something that will fly right out of the box, get a ready-to-fly (fully assembled) one (you only need to add a battery and RC-gear of your choice).

<h1>Batteries and RC gear</h1>
If you don't already have batteries/chargers and RC gear, here are some suggestions:
<ul>
	<li><strong><strong>LiPo battery and charger:</strong></strong>You can read basic info about LiPo batteries <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/lipo_basics.asp">here</a>.</li>
	<li>You'll also need a charger, power supply (if not included with the charger) and some connectors (remember to use same type of connectors on battery, charger and PDB).</li>
	<li><strong>RC gear:
</strong> You'll need at least a six-channel RC unit. There are many, many models out there and ArduCopter works with all of them. Get a 2.4GHz one with a Failsafe feature. Two good failsafe functions are A) the throttle on the receiver goes to zero if there's no signal, and B) the receiver has a programmable failsafe allowing the user to program it to put the APM into an RTL mode with sticks centered . We've used many of them, from the Futaba 7C series and Spectrum DX-8 to the very inexpensive Turnigy 9X (_The 9X is recommended with hesitation because it demonstrates poor failsafe functionality, as well as problems with the potentiometers in the control sticks, both of which can cause fly-aways. The failsafe problem can be solved by replacing the Tx module and Rx with Frsky components, but there is no easy fix for the potentiometers._) Another option is to buy a used name brand transmitter from the 72MHz era. Some of these models used replaceable frequency modules, which can actually be easily replaced with an Frsky 2.4GHz module to bring them up to spec. A notable example of this would be the Futaba 9C range. The Frsky Tx modules and receivers very affordable, yet also perform very well and are highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
The choice is yours but do some research and see what others are using.
