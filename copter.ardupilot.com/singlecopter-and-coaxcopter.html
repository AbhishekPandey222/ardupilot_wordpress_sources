<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Warning the SingleCopter (available since AC3.1) and CoaxCopter (available since AC3.2) are not regularly used and have not been extensively tested!
</strong></span>

<strong>As this is VERY new many of the Single copters shown here use either mil-spec or very simple stabilize mode controllers.</strong>

<h3>SingleCopter</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A SingleCopter is an aerial vehicle with one central rotating propeller thrusting downward past 4 controllable vanes.</li>
	<li>The 4 control vanes (one in each quadrant) permits the control of the vehicles roll, pitch and yaw.</li>
	<li>The vanes also permit real time compensation for the motors direction of rotation.</li>
	<li>Altitude is controlled by adjusting the motor / propeller speed.<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/vtolcustom2.jpg"><img src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/vtolcustom2.jpg" alt="vtolcustom2" width="750" height="419" /></a></li>
</ul>
<strong>An innovatively designed and quite successful hobbyist SingleCopter </strong>

<h4>Connecting the Flight Controller to the SingleCopter:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Connect the APM, PX4 or Pixhawk servo output channels 1-4 to the SingleCopters 4 control fins as shown.</li>
	<li>Connect the APM, PX4 or Pixhawk servo output channel 7 to the ESC for the brushless motor that powers the main single rotor</li>
	<li>The 4 fins are attached to four arms and it's a bit like a Plus quad.</li>
	<li>Looking down on the APM from above as in the attached diagram. "servo1" would be attached to the APM's output channel #1, etc.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/SingleCopterBothView1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10103" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/SingleCopterBothView1.jpg" alt="SingleCopterBothView1" width="800" height="600" /></a>
<h4>Load the Firmware</h4>
<ul>
	<li>For the time being, the user needs to compile the source code themselves.</li>
	<li>Add this line to the APM_Config.h: <strong>#define FRAME_CONFIG SINGLE_FRAME</strong></li>
	<li>In the near future this will be added as a downloadable binary to <strong>firmware.diydrones.com</strong> and likely as a Mission Planner loadable icon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
If digital servos are used the SV_SPEED parameter can be set to 125 (or even higher).  If slower analog servos are used set this parameter to 50.
<h3>CoaxCopter</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A CoaxCopter is an aerial vehicle with two counter rotating central propellers thrusting downward past 2 controllable vanes (one side to side and the other from front to back) that permit control of roll and pitch.</li>
	<li>Yaw is controlled by varying top and bottom propeller speeds relative to each other.</li>
	<li>There are two variant motor configurations of the CoaxCopter:
<ul>
	<li>A contra-rotating motor pair with both Propellers on top and the shaft of the bottom motor passing up through the hollow shaft of the top motor</li>
	<li>And two motors mounted back to back with one propeller above and the other beneath with appropriate support struts.</li>
	<li>Both variations are illustrated below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Connecting the Flight Controller to the CoaxCopter:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Connect the APM, PX4 or Pixhawk servo output channels 1 and 2 to the CoaxCopters two control fins servos as shown (Note: the diagram below is incorrect, "Servo3" should be "Servo1" and "Servo4" should be "Servo2").</li>
	<li>Connect the APM, PX4 or Pixhawk servo output channel 3 and 4 to the ESC for the brushless motors that power the main dual rotors.</li>
	<li>The two wide fins are attached to two cross arms and works a bit like the elevator and ailerons of a fixed wing plane.</li>
	<li>Below is an illustration looking down on an APM/Pixhawk mounted on the frame.  Note the warning re Servo3 and Servo4 being mislabelled.</li>
</ul>
