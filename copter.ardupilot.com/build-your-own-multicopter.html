<h1>There are Lots of Ways you Can Put Together a MultiCopter</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Thoughtful, slow progression is better than jumping in with both feet, you can easily get discouraged by trying to do too much too fast.</li>
	<li>You are likely to have a good experience if you start with a simple, small QuadCopter, either a Ready to Fly or an All Inclusive Kit.</li>
	<li>For for those with good DIY capabilities an Almost Ready To Fly build like the F450 FlameWheel described below can also work well.</li>
	<li>For your first MultiCopter, DO NOT initially try to build a Photo / Video or First Person View copter, just build a good QuadCopter.</li>
	<li>Even if you know that's what you really want to do, it will take you some time to come up to speed on our copters and flight controllers.</li>
	<li>If you just want to get a taste and have a lot of fun, try one of the little inexpensive, safe, sturdy, ready to use Micro-QuadCopters below.</li>
	<li>If you know you're serious, try the <strong>Flamewheel ARF Build</strong> or if you just want to fly and can afford it get the high end <strong>Iris</strong> QuadCopter.</li>
	<li>The Iris includes a top end <strong>Pixhawk</strong> flight controller and both the Iris and the Flamewheel can do <strong>FPV</strong> or <strong>Video</strong> when you are ready.</li>
	<li>Don't start with a <strong>Frame Up Build</strong> unless you have a complete article on how to build a really good simple Quadcopter like the Flip Sport.</li>
	<li>Absolutely do not start by trying to <strong>Build Your Own Frame</strong>, even among experienced builders there are more failures than successes.</li>
	<li>It is very important to <strong>NOT</strong> start out with a big (dangerous) multicopter with a bunch of photo or video stuff on it, you will regret it.</li>
	<li>A small, agile <strong>QuadCopter</strong> is always a lot more fun to fly than a big, ponderous and slow <strong>Hex</strong> or <strong>OctoCopter</strong> in any case.</li>
	<li>Except for top end professional HD video or photography requiring big cameras you are always better off thinking small, light and agile.</li>
</ol>
[warning]Safety is very important with multicopters, keep plenty of distance from living or expensive things and review our <a href="safety-multicopter">Safety Page</a>.[/warning]

<h1>Chinese Imports Good Deal / Bad Deal?</h1>
<ol>
	<li>It is very tempting especially when just starting out to buy lots of Chinese direct import stuff because it is so much cheaper: Bad Idea!</li>
	<li>As you gain experience, you will learn which import items are serviceable, if you try to do it at the beginning things will not go well.</li>
	<li>I recommend you always get the main electronics (Flight Controller) from the primary source, in our case the Pixhawk from 3DRobotics.</li>
	<li>You will also want to get the electronic accessories (GPS, magentometer, telemetry and OSD if used) from 3DRobotics as well.</li>
	<li>If your going to do first person view, get a 3DRobotics FPV kit or a FatShark Attitude video goggle and transmitter.</li>
	<li>As for cameras, the GoPro Hero 3 and especially the Black is the one to get, because it is what everybody uses and it works well.</li>
	<li>The DJI Flamewheel ARF kit which is recommended is made in China but is a known quality setup, so where you get it is up to you.</li>
	<li>The Traxxas, Hubsan and Helimax highly recommended starter micro-Quadcopters are also made in China but are still a great way to start.</li>
	<li>Motors, Batteries, ESCs, frames and even FRSky or Turnigy RC transmitters and receivers can be very good deals direct from China.</li>
	<li>A lot of items we buy domestically are actually made in China and of course, quality varies widely, regardless of country of origin.</li>
	<li>A $25.00 RC-Timer motor is not likely to be of the same quality as the equivalent $100.00 Tiger-Motor, but hey, it's only $25.00.</li>
	<li>Although direct Chinese imports generally have pretty reliable shipping, aftermarket support or returns are often very problematic.</li>
	<li>If you build in a ten to twenty percent broken, damaged or not included expectation for Chinese imports you will not be disappointed.</li>
	<li>In any case, start with two or three of the recommended "builds" below so that you can experience success and learn to fly first.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Inexpensive, Ready To Fly Nano, Micro or Small QuadCopter</h1>
[tip]If you are new to MultiCopters, I very strongly suggest you start with one of these inexpensive Ready To Fly QuadCopters.[/tip]
<ol>
	<li>They come with everything you need including the radio and the battery, require no assembly, are very sturdy and are great for learning.</li>
	<li>They are also a ton of fun, can easily and safely be used indoors and typically cost less than a hundred dollars.</li>
	<li>Importantly you will get you a much better understanding of how they work and of what you really want to do next.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://traxxas.com/products/models/heli/6208qr1">Traxxas QR1 QuadCopter</a> is an inexpensive RTF Micro Quadcopter that is great for a first experience. (Left image below).</li>
	<li>For $45.00 the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hubsan-X4-H107-Copter-2-4GHZ/dp/B009M1PO7W">(Hubsan X4)</a> is identical to the Traxxas and for $70.00 you can get it with a still photo and 720P HD video camera.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hubsan-X4-H107-Copter-2-4GHZ/dp/B009M1PO7W">Husban</a></li>
	<li>For $200.00 there is even a really easy to fly <strong>FPV</strong> version of the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/171203630670?lpid=82&quot;">Hubsan</a> that comes with a RC transmitter with an excellent LCD display.</li>
	<li>Even the parts for the Hubsans are readily available: <a href="http://hobbyflip.com/">Hobby Flip</a></li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.helimax-rc.com/helicopters/hmxe0834-1sq/index.html">Helimax 1SQ</a> is another low cost palm sized micro QuadCopter.</li>
	<li>Or even the really, really tiny $40.00 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Estes-4606-Proto-Nano-Quadcopter/dp/B00G924W98">Estes Proto X</a> actually a Hubsan H111 which flies remarkably well (Middle and right images below).</li>

	<li>If you are just starting out: Get one of these inexpensive, small, durable Quadcopters and learn to fly it well, it will save you a lot of money.</li>
</ul>
<h1>All Inclusive Kit</h1>
<ol>
	<li>The easiest way to build is to buy a single kit that has all the parts necessary in one box and a set of instructions for each step.</li>
	<li>Outside of (Ready To Fly) a good all inclusive kit is the most reliable and straightforward way to construct a quality MultiCopter.</li>
	<li>Usually all of the components are well balanced with each other and the entire craft can be expected to perform well.</li>
	<li>For an all inclusive kit, assembly is just nuts and bolts and possibly some soldering.</li>
	<li>The assembly procedure is usually well explained in the supplied instructions.</li>
	<li>The downside is that often quality kits are a bit more expensive than other alternatives and customization has to be added on.</li>
	<li>If you are not already well qualified at Do It Yourself projects, A good all inclusive kit is definitely the best place to start.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/diy-quad-kit">3DR DIY Quad Kit</a> and <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/diy-y6-kit">3DR DIY Y6 Kit</a> are complete assemble it yourself kits with a Pixhawk flight controller</li>
	<li>The innovative <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/iris">Iris QuadCopter</a> is actually <strong>Ready To Fly</strong> and comes with the top of the line <strong>Pixhawk</strong> flight controller.
<ol>
	<li>It is capable of fully autonomous flight and includes the RC transmitter, the battery and even telemetry, at $750.00 it is a real bargain.</li>
	<li>The Iris structurally strong and resilient and it is set up to support a GoPro camera or even FPV (First Person View) when you are ready.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/AeduCopterAndIris.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9652" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/AeduCopterAndIris.jpg" alt="AeduCopterAndIris" width="1299" height="406" /></a>

	<li>Erle Robotics also offers a DIY kit (named <a href="https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-copter-diy-ubuntu-drone-kit/" target="_blank">Erle-Copter Drone Kit</a>, starting from 449€) which includes <a href="https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-brain-v2/" target="_blank">Erle-Brain</a>, Linux-based autopilot. You can personalize your kit and you can also purchase the kit assembled.</li>
<ol>
<li>The basic DIY kit includes all the needed to assemble the drone plus 6 channels RC, a WiFi dongle to receive telemetry data and a battery charger. If you wish to make autonomous missions, you need to acquire a GPS.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<h1>Almost Ready to Fly</h1>
<ol>
	<li>If you need everything and want the most versatile copter possible you can't beat the Iris above, it is simply a great deal.</li>
	<li>If you already have a RC transmitter you can save some money and still build a really high quality autonomous QuadCopter.</li>
	<li>Even if you are just starting there are a few really good choices.
<ol>
	<li>The <strong>DJI F450 Flamewheel QuadCopter ARF Kit</strong> may well be single the best choice at this time.</li>
	<li>This kit comes with frame with built in power distribution board, the 4 motors and the 4 Electronic Speed Controls and 8 Propellers.</li>
	<li>You need to add a <a href="common-pixhawk-overview">Pixhawk</a> Flight controller, A battery and your Radio Control Transmitter and Receiver.</li>
	<li>The supplied equipment in the kit is all first rate and the real DJI Flamewheel frame is very stiff and sturdy (a good thing).</li>
	<li>Cost: F450 ARF kit $180.00, Pixhawk with GPS/Compass $280.00 and a Battery $35.00 = ($495.00) plus a PPM-Sum receiver.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>As an alternative, the smaller <strong>DJI F330 Flamewheel Quadcopter</strong> is also an excellent choice and can be better in smaller spaces.
<ol>
	<li>The <a href="dji-f330-flamewheel">Wiki page on constructing the F330</a> is applicable to the <strong>F450</strong> as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Most ARF kits that are cheaper than this are not nearly as sturdy and the components generally fail much more frequently.</li>
	<li>You can buy the <a href="http://www.amainhobbies.com/product_info.php/cPath/2_382_2405_3233_3237/products_id/235232/n/DJI-Innovations-Flame-Wheel-F450-ARF-Quadcopter-Kit-w-Motors-ESC-Propellers">F450 ARF kit Here!</a> This source has the <strong>F350 ARF</strong> kit also.</li>
	<li>DO NOT get a clone kit that looks like it, the real DJI motors and ESCs are top quality and the frame is stiff and strong, the clones are not.</li>
	<li>There are more expensive high quality ARF kits available but the FlameWheels will give great service and have very high performance.</li>
	<li>If you want to keep initial cost to a bare minimum, start with a <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__24723__Hobbyking_KK2_0_Multi_rotor_LCD_Flight_Control_Board.html">Simple Flight Controller</a> then graduate to a <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-pixhawk">Pixhawk</a> when you are ready</li>
	<li>The F450 can also serve as a competent Gopro and Gimbal carrying photo and video copter or as an FPV platform.</li>
	<li>The <strong>DJI F550 ARF Hexacopter</strong> is a good choice for more advanced uses, but it is not ideal as a first MultiCopter.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Frame Kit</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Once you get into building your own MultiCopter based on a frame kit you are getting into the big leagues, this is really not for beginners.</li>
	<li>The exception is if you are carefully following a specific and highly detailed build.</li>
	<li>I am working on 2 Frame Kit based builds at the moment, a Flip 380 Sport QuadCopter and a Tarot 650 Carbon Fiber Quadcopter.</li>
	<li>A little bit on the reasons for and methods used in each of the Builds.</li>
	<li>The Hoverthings <a href="http://www.hoverthings.com/the-flip-black">Flip 380 Sport</a> Frame is billed as the most indestructible frame ever.
<ol>
	<li>It uses incredibly stiff and strong CNC machined 1/4" thick Fiberglass arms and G10 Fiberglass center plates.</li>
	<li>It can incorporate the same motors and ESCs as used in the DJI Flamewheel and can use up to 10" propellers.</li>
	<li>I purchased the Flip Sport Kit plus an extra pair of "tab" type center sections and extra 7/8" spacers.</li>
	<li>The extra center plates mount below the stock plates on 7/8" spacers to accommodate the battery and flight gear.</li>
	<li>I am using 4 of the stock DJI Flamewheel motors and a special <a href="http://mymobilemms.com/OFFTHEGRIDWATER.CA/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_4&amp;products_id=203">4 in 1 ESC</a> placed between the center plates of the copter.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/3281_dimg2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5596" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/3281_dimg2.jpg" alt="3281_dimg2" width="400" height="228" /></a></li>
	<li>The 4 in 1 ESC produces much less RF and DC interference and is neater than 4 ESCs and a power distribution board.</li>
	<li>I am using <a href="http://www.rcdude.com/servlet/the-2498/GemFan-DJI-Hub-10x4.5/Detail">GemFan DJI hub compatible 10" carbon filled propellers</a> because they are very tough and very efficient.</li>
	<li>My goal is to build an even tougher and higher performance copter than the DJI F450 Flamewheel - inexpensively.</li>
	<li>Although it's a small copter the Flip is powerful and agile enough to use FPV video and/or a GoPro Camera and brushless gimbal.</li>
	<li>Here is a link to the <a href="hoverthings-flip-sport-quadcopter">Hoverthings Flip Sport Quadcopter Wiki Build Page</a> using a Pixhawk or PX4 flight controller.

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/FlipPX41.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11116" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/FlipPX41.jpg" alt="FlipPX41" width="584" height="326" /></a></li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tarot-Iron-Man-650-Foldable-3K-carbon-fiber-Quad-copter-Quadcopter-Frame-TL65B02-/151050276421" target="_blank"><strong>Tarot 650</strong></a> is a carbon fiber frame that is quite large for a QuadCopter and it can incorporate up to 17" propellers.
<ol>
	<li>I am using 360kv slow speed, large diameter <strong>Pancake Motors</strong> designed to turn the more efficient large propellers at low speeds.</li>
	<li>I will be using a variety of 14" to 17" propellers to explore performance and efficiency at various propeller diameters.</li>
	<li>Although the Flip Sport build shown above could be appropriate for a first QuadCopter, this Tarot 650 build is definitely not.</li>
	<li>This quad is big enough to serve as a heavy lift or long endurance copter or to carry a big video or still camera, but:
<ol>
	<li>For lifting a 2KG payload with a quadcopter you need some serious motor and some serious prop.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rctigermotor.com/html/2013/Navigator_0910/38.html" target="_blank">Four Tigermotor  MN4010 475 KV motors</a> at $86.00 each, four 15 x 5 or 16 x 5 props and four high quality 30 amp ESCs.</li>
	<li>It needs 10,000mah of 4 cell Lipo batteries (two 5000's) to achieve approximately ~10 minutes of flight time at 4KG total weight.</li>
	<li>It should be capable of lifting 4 KG total (including 2KG payload) and leave about 50% reserve thrust (minimum needed) (6kg total).</li>
	<li>You will need 16" x 5  props to achieve the thrust and efficiency necessary to lift 4KG total with reasonable flight times.</li>
	<li>That is why the bigger motors with the lower KV are required and they need to be high quality to withstand continuous high output.</li>
	<li>It is very highly recommended that you do not attempt to construct one of these for your first build.</li>

<h1>Scratch Built</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Although this is often attempted by those who have never used a multicopter, it very seldom turns out well.</li>
	<li>At the simplest level a functioning QuadCopter can be built out of sticks or dowels and plywood that will fly.</li>
	<li>But it is very unlikely to fly well or to be very serviceable or to well tolerate less than perfect "landings".</li>
	<li>And this is no way to save money, RTF, Kits and ARF include high quality matched components and actually cost less.</li>
	<li>Even if you are an experienced model builder, machinist or engineer, DO NOT START HERE!</li>
	<li>Multicopters have their whole own set of flight dynamics and structural demands.</li>
	<li>Until you have become experienced with them you stand virtually no chance of designing and making a worthwhile MultiCopter.</li>
	<li>There is a really lovely QuadCopter design made by a newbie from bent sheet aluminum on our site right now.</li>
	<li>Unfortunately sheet aluminum is soft, the copter is heavy and hard landings are common so a very bent copter is inevitable.</li>
	<li>Even if you are very experienced, you will certainly need to make several copters before you achieve a worthwhile design.</li>
	<li>I won't say Experts only, but you really need to go through at least 3 or 4 commercial MultiCopters before you even think about doing this.</li>
	<li>I have made over a dozen different CAD designs so far and have not yet built one, I will make one, but I'm not ready yet and I know it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Brand Name Ready to Fly</h1>
A few words about the <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">Brand Name</strong> Ready To Fly QuadCopters like the <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">Parrot</strong>, the <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">DJI Phantom</strong> and the <strong style="color: #000000;font-style: normal">Blade 350QX</strong>.
<ol>
	<li>Within the scope of their capabilities these are generally well made and often a reasonable bargain for what they do.</li>
	<li>But they are also not easily modified or improved on and are not easy to upgrade to a more powerful flight controller like the Pixhawk.</li>
	<li>So although they are a moderately capable one stop solution, they can also be a bit of a costly dead end.</li>
	<li>You can put together a <strong>Flamewheel ARF kit</strong> with a top end <strong>Pixhawk flight controller</strong> for about the same money and be way ahead.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Which Approach is Right for You</h1>
<ol>
	<li>It is very important to match your approach to your capability level, if you overreach you can end up with a negative experience.</li>
	<li>It is also much more important to take a robust and conservative approach than to try to do everything the first time out.
<ol>
	<li>The simplest approach is to get a <strong>Ready to Fly</strong> system or an <strong>All Inclusive Kit</strong>.</li>
	<li>However, a good <strong>Almost Ready To Fly</strong> kit plus some carefully chosen components can also result in an outstanding copter.</li>
	<li>The ARF approach can often cost somewhat less and enable you to construct a copter that is specifically tailored to your needs.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Frame Kit</strong> approach presumes that you have sufficient knowledge to specify appropriate components that will work together.</li>
	<li>But it does let you put together a copter that is specifically optimized for your needs and desires.</li>
	<li>Unless you find and scrupulously follow a comprehensive article detailing a specific "build" a Frame Kit should not be your first copter.</li>
	<li>Clearly that goes double for <strong>Scratch Built</strong>. It isn't actually all that hard to build a MultiCopter frame.</li>
	<li>But the overall process and component matching to make it work well is really for the experienced MultiCopter operator / builder.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>There are expensive, high end Multicopters, which are generally oriented to commercial photo or video use and outside our scope here.</li>
	<li>All of the Copters I have and will be putting together incorporate 3DR APM, PX4 or <a href="common-pixhawk-overview">Pixhawk</a> Flight Controllers.
<ol>
	<li>These are the best and most capable flight controllers available and they have great <strong>DIYDrones</strong> community support.</li>
	<li>Beware of clones and counterfeits, they often have small differences that end up making them completely unusable.</li>
	<li>Don't say I didn't warn you: "Caveat Emptor" and "You get what you pay for".
