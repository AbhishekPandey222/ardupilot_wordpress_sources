Loiter Mode automatically attempts to maintain the current location, heading and altitude. The pilot may fly the copter in Loiter mode as if it were in manual. Releasing the sticks will continue to hold position.

Good GPS position, <a href="wiki/common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs/#Compass_interference">low magnetic interference on the compass </a>and <a href="wiki/common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs/#Vibrations">low vibrations</a> are all important in achieving good loiter performance.

<h1>Controls</h1>

The pilot can control the copter's position with the control sticks.
<ul>
	<li>Horizontal location can be adjusted with the the Roll and Pitch control sticks with the default maximum horizontal speed being 5m/s (see Tuning section below on how to adjust this).  When the pilot releases the sticks the copter will slow to a stop.</li>
	<li>Altitude can be controlled with the Throttle control stick just as in <a href="wiki/altholdmode/#Controls">AltHold mode</a></li>
	<li>The heading can be set with the Yaw control stick</li>
</ul>
In AC3.1 (and above) you may arm in Loiter mode but only once the GPS has 3D lock and the HDOP has dropped to 2.0 or lower.
On an APM2 the board's blue light will become solid when 3D lock is attained.  On a Pixhawk the LED will become green (<a href="wiki/common-apm-board-leds/">more details on LED patterns here</a>).
The HDOP value can be made clearly visible through the mission planner's Quick screen by double clicking and then selecting "gpshdop" from the large grid of checkboxes.

<h1>Tuning</h1>
<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/Loiter_Tuning.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11036" alt="Loiter_Tuning" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/Loiter_Tuning.png" width="1023" height="575" /></a>

Loiter mode incorporates the altitude controller from AltHold mode.  Details for tuning <a href="wiki/altholdmode/#Tuning">AltHold are on this wiki page</a>.

The maximum horizontal speed of the copter during loiter mode can be adjusted with the Loiter Speed (aka WPNAV_LOIT_SPEED) parameter on the Config/Tuning &gt;&gt; Copter Pids screen.  The value is expressed in cm/s so 500 = 5m/s.  The maximum acceleration during Loiter mode is always 1/2 of the Loiter speed.

The Loiter PID's P value (top right of the screen shot above) is used to conver the horizontal position error (i.e difference between the desired position and the actual position) to a desired speed towards the target position.  <strong>It is generally not required to adjust this.</strong>

The Rate Loiter PID values are used to convert the desired speed towards the target to a desired acceleration.  The resulting desired acceleration becomes a lean angle which is then passed to the same angular controller used by <a href="wiki/stabilize-mode/">Stabilize mode</a>.  <strong>It is generally not required to adjust this.</strong>



<h1>Verifying Loiter performance with dataflash logs</h1>
Viewing the loiter's horizontal performance is best done by <a href="common-downloading-and-analyzing-data-logs-in-mission-planner">downloading a dataflash log</a> from your flight, then open it with the mission planner and graph the NTUN message’s DesVelX vs VelX and DesVelY vs VelY.  In a good performing copter the acxtual velocities will track the desired velocities as shown below.  X = latitude (so positive = moving North, negative = South), Y = longitude (positive = East, negative = West).

<a href="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/Loiter_TuningCheck.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11039" alt="Loiter_TuningCheck" src="http://copter.ardupilot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/12/Loiter_TuningCheck.png" width="1302" height="564" /></a>

Checking altitude hold performance is the same as for <a href="wiki/altholdmode/#Verifying_AltHold_performance_with_dataflash_logs">AltHold</a> mode.



<h1>Common Problems</h1>
As mentioned above, Loiter mode incorporates the altitude controller from AltHold mode.  Alt hold issues are on the <a href="wiki/altholdmode/#Common_Problems">AltHold wiki page</a>.
<ol>
	<li>The vehicle <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-3G9ZvXHhk" target="_blank">circles (aka "toiletbowls")</a>.  This is normally caused by a compass problem the most likely being <a href="wiki/common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs/#Compass_interference">magnetic interference</a> from the power cables under the flight controller.  Running <a href="common-compass-setup-advanced/#compassmot_8211_compensation_for_interference_from_the_power_wires_escs_and_motors">compassmot</a> or purchasing a <a href="wiki/common-installing-3dr-ublox-gps-compass-module/">GPS+compass module</a> normal resolves this.  Other possibilities include bad compass offsets set during the <a href="wiki/initial-setup/configuring-hardware/#Calibrate_Compass">live calibration process</a> or incorrect compass orientation.</li>
	<li>The vehicle takes off in the wrong direction as soon as loiter is engaged.  The cause is the same as #1 except that the compass error is greater than 90deg.  Please try the suggestions above to resolve this.</li>
	<li>The vehicle is loitering normally and then suddenly takes off in the wrong direction.  This is generally caused by a <a href="wiki/gps-failsafe/">GPS Glitch</a>.  There is no 100% reliable protection against these which means the pilot should always be ready to take-over manual control.  Beyond that ensuring a good GPS HDOP before take-off is always good and it may help to reduce the GPSGLITCH_RADIUS and/or GPSGLITCH_ACCEL parameters (see <a href="wiki/gps-failsafe/">GPSGlitch wiki page</a> for details) to tighten up on the glitch detection.</li>
</ol>



<h1>OF_LOITER Mode</h1>
OF_LOITER is a special version of Loiter mode that will use the Optical Flow device to maintain position. It is not yet implemented but work is ongoing. Do Not select OF_LOITER mode until an update of Copter specifies that it is installed and working.
