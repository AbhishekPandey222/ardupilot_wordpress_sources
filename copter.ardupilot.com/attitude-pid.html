The attitude of the copter is controlled by a nested PI-&gt;PID loop. Tuning the inner PID loop is essential to good stable flight. The outer PI loop is less sensitive and effects mostly the style of flying desired (fast or slow).

<h3>Overview</h3>
The inner PID loop looks at the desired rate of angular rotation and compares that to the raw gyro output. The difference is feed back into the PID controller and sent to the motors to correct the rotation. This is the heart of both Rate(Acro) mode, Stabilize mode, and all other modes. It is also the most critical gain to adjust for your copter.

The outer PI loop generates the desired rate of angular rotation. The input for this loop can either be user with stick movement, or the stabilizer, which tries to achieve a specific angle.

To get a better idea of the flow of command to motor output, here is a diagram of the Roll control.

<h3>PID Rate Tuning</h3>
Parameter: RATE_RLL_P and RATE_PIT_P are the proportional response and the default is 0.14. Your copter will vary quite a bit depending on the weight and thrust of your engines. If your copter oscillates rapidly, lower this value. If it is sluggish, raise the value. This is the
<strong>#1 parameter
</strong> that needs tuning. If it is not right, every other parameter is a waste of time.

Parameter: RATE_RLL_I and RATE_PIT_I are set to 0 by default. Use this value to maintain tight control of the speed of rotation the copter. If the copter is not achieving the rotation rate needed to hold a tight attitude, this term will make up the difference.

Parameter: RATE_RLL_D and RATE_PIT_D is .0025 by default. This value will dampen the acceleration towards the target angle. It If the value is too high you will see small, fast oscillations in pitch or roll. You may even temporarily loose control of pitch or roll as the D term saturates the control output.

Parameter: STAB_D is .06 by default. This dampens the acceleration of rotation of the copter and can eliminate those small wobbles after a set point change (a quick angle change). This is similar to RATE_RLL_D but only dampens acceleration. STAB_D is similar to RATE_RLL_D, but it's unfiltered (faster) and has inherently less noise than RATE_RLL_D. Just as the RATE_RLL_D, a large value may cause oscillations or temporarily loss of control of pitch or roll as the D term saturates the control output.

Note: When tuning your copter, set RATE_I and RATE_D to zero, and only tune RATE_P. Once you have that dialed in, then tune RATE_I and RATE_D.

<h3>PI Control Tuning</h3>
Parameter: STB_RLL_P and STB_RLL_P is by default 4.5 or 4.5° per second rotation for every 1° of error. If you want more or less speed of rotation based on user input, adjust this value. A larger Octo may want to have a smaller number, 3.5 perhaps, or you will get a large seesaw style oscillation.

Parameter: STB_RLL_I and STB_PIT_I are used to overcome imbalance in the copter. If the copter is not symmetrical this iterm will bring the copter to level. The higher the number the faster the copter will compensate. Low numbers can have adverse effects by causing a very slow oscillation measured in seconds. If you use this term, consider potential conflicts in timing with Rate_I. It may be best to keep one or the other zero.
