Jethro Hazelhurst produced this magnificent Pixhawk wiring chart for a Quadcopter for us.

(Control Scroll wheel will let you zoom in on the image below!)

<h3>This chart Illustrates a quadcopter with a variety of options.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A 4 in 1 ESC is used instead of individual ESCs reducing EMF and allowing a neater installation and no power distribution board.</li>
	<li>Actual Motor number to Quadcopter frame location is shown below and will require appropriate signal and motor wire routing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A 3DR PPM-Sum encoder with conventional receiver is illustrated, A PPM-Sum receiver could be used instead.</li>
	<li>Generally a 3S or 4S LiPo battery is appropriate for a Quadcopter and the XT60 connectors shown are a reliable choice.</li>
	<li>An optional battery warning indicator can provide quick battery status and provide an audible warning when nearby.</li>
	<li>Optional 3DR telemetry radios may be connected to your Pixhawk and tablet or laptop to permit real time monitoring and operation.
<ul>
	<li>A (GCS (Ground Control Station) program like Mission Planner, AndroPilot or DroidPlanner provides in flight information and control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>An optional GoPro camera and brushless gimbal are illustrated and can provide very high quality photo and video results.
<ul>
	<li>It is quite reasonable to use a GoPro camera and brushless gimbal on 400 and larger Quadcopters.</li>
	<li>Brushless camera gimbals perform more smoothly and adequately than the older servo type gimbals.</li>
	<li>The brushless gimbal illustrated above has an anti-vibration mount which is important for good photo results.</li>
	<li>For cameras larger than GoPro or "Sport" types, a larger QuadCopter, HexaCopter or OctoCopter should be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You could also install an optional FPV (First Person View) video system but it is not shown in the illustration above.
<ul>
	<li>An FPV system consists of a tiny video camera and transmitter on the copter plus a receiver and video goggles or an LCD screen.</li>
	<li>Almost any size Quadcopter can support a First Person View system.</li>
	<li>An optional OSD (On Screen Display) can add a video heads up display of current in flight conditions to your FPV flight display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The telemetry, camera, gimbal, FPV and OSD options mentioned above can be combined as you wish for your copter but start simple.</li>
</ul>
